0,KAREN JACOBSON,Climate change and urban migration in sub-saharan African cities: impacts and governance challenges,"Urban informal settlements are rapidly expanding in countries around the world. This is due partly to high birth rates, but also because of growing in-migration driven by climate change impacts affecting rural populations. Urban informal settlements struggle with degraded and sometimes nonexistent infrastructure (such as water, sewage, and drainage systems) and service provision (health, education), and these shortcomings are aggravated by urban climate-related hazards like flooding and heat spikes. As informal settlements expand, their already overburdened infrastructure can lead to urban disasters such as flooding and landfill collapse. These challenges increase the governance and financial problems already faced by cities and create significant problems for climate resilience planning processes. Policy responses at both the national and city levels promise much but deliver little. This article reviews …",2023,U00279444,"JACOBSON, KAREN",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
1,KAREN JACOBSON,"Urban policy responses to climate hazards in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Urban in-migration, high birth rates and unchecked development are driving the continued growth of African cities. Much of this urbanization occurs in informal settlements, where unplanned growth exacerbates the impacts of climate hazards. Our paper explores the challenges faced by urban planners seeking to address climate change threats in African cities. Focusing on Addis Ababa, we conduct a robust policy analysis of urban government response. Our main finding is that Addis Ababa’s environmental challenges are primarily a result of urban development and inadequate planning and policy enforcement. Environmental challenges are exacerbated by rapidly intensifying climate impacts, but not driven by them. Improved city-level policy responses can potentially mitigate many of Addis Ababa’s current environmental challenges and prepare the city to weather future ones. We highlight four areas of policy …",2024,U00279444,"JACOBSON, KAREN",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
2,STEFANIA GARETTO,Global Banking and the International Transmission of Shocks: A Quantitative Analysis,"Regulatory reforms typically follow financial crises. We propose a model of global banking that can be used proactively to study alternative regulatory policies. The model mimics the US regulatory framework and highlights the organizational choices that banks face when entering a foreign market: branching versus subsidiarization. The model is able to replicate the response of the US banking sector to the European sovereign debt crisis. Counterfactual analysis suggests that pervasive subsidiarization, higher capital requirements, or an ad hoc monetary policy intervention would have avoided entirely the negative effects of the sovereign debt crisis on US lending. However, the same measures would have had limited effects in more severe scenarios.",2023,U00773544,"GARETTO, STEFANIA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
3,JAMES BIRD,Coastal response to Holocene Sea-level change: A case study from Singapore,"The deceleration of early to mid-Holocene (10–7 cal. ka BP) relative sea-level rise (RSLR) played a key role in transforming coastal systems from estuaries to deltas. Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of coastal evolution provide case studies that can help project the response of modern coastal systems to future RSLR. The response of deltas to future RSLR is particularly important to South, Southeast and East Asia which collectively contain 71% of the global coastal population living below 10 m in elevation and 75% of the global coastal floodplain population. However, few Holocene studies of equatorial delta systems exist.Here, we investigate the early to mid-Holocene coastal response to decelerating rates of RSLR through paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the Kallang River Basin, Singapore. We produce a multi-proxy (sedimentology, stable carbon isotope, XRF elemental ratios) record from sediment core …",2023,U96921436,"BIRD, JAMES",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
4,JAMES BIRD,Provenance of aerosol black carbon over northeast Indian ocean and South China sea and implications for oceanic black carbon cycling,"Aerosol black carbon (BC) is a short-lived climate pollutant. The poorly constrained provenance of tropical marine aerosol BC hinders the mechanistic understanding of extreme climate events and oceanic carbon cycling. Here, we collected PM2.5 samples during research cruise NORC2016-10 through South China Sea (SCS) and Northeast Indian Ocean (NEIO) and measured the dual-carbon isotope compositions (δ13C–Δ14C) of BC using hydrogen pyrolysis technique. Aerosol BC exhibits six different δ13C−Δ14C isotopic spaces (i.e., isotope provinces). Liquid fossil fuel combustion, from shipping emissions and adjacent land, is the predominant source of BC over isotope provinces “SCS close to Chinese Mainland” (53.5%), “Malacca Strait” (53.4%), and “Open NEIO” (40.7%).

5,JAMES BIRD,"Soil pyrogenic carbon in southern Amazonia: Interaction between soil, climate, and above-ground biomass","The Amazon forest represents one of the world’s largest terrestrial carbon reservoirs. Here, we evaluated the role of soil texture, climate, vegetation, and distance to savanna on the distribution and stocks of soil pyrogenic carbon (PyC) in intact forests with no history of recent fire spanning the southern Amazonia forest-Cerrado Zone of Transition (ZOT). In 19 one hectare forest plots, including three Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE, terra preta) sites with high soil PyC, we measured all trees and lianas with diameter ≥ 10 cm and analyzed soil physicochemical properties, including texture and PyC stocks. We quantified PyC stocks as a proportion of total organic carbon using hydrogen pyrolysis. We used multiple linear regression and variance partitioning to determine which variables best explain soil PyC variation. For all forests combined, soil PyC stocks ranged between 0.9 and 6.8 Mg/ha to 30 cm depth (mean 2.3 ± 1.5 Mg/ha) and PyC, on average, represented 4.3% of the total soil organic carbon (SOC). The most parsimonious model (based on AICc) included soil clay content and above-ground biomass (AGB) as the main predictors, explaining 71% of soil PyC variation. After removal of the ADE plots, PyC stocks ranged between 0.9 and 3.8 Mg/ha (mean 1.9 ± 0.8 Mg/ha–1) and PyC continued to represent ∼4% of the total SOC. The most parsimonious models without ADE included AGB and sand as the best predictors, with sand and PyC having an inverse relationship, and sand explaining 65% of the soil PyC variation. Partial regression analysis did not identify any of the components (climatic, environmental, and edaphic), pure or shared, as …",2022,U96921436,"BIRD, JAMES",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
6,JAMES BIRD,Ancient fires enhance Amazon forest drought resistance,"Drought and fire reduce productivity and increase tree mortality in tropical forests. Fires also produce pyrogenic carbon (PyC), which persists in situ for centuries to millennia, and represents a legacy of past fires, potentially improving soil fertility and water holding capacity and selecting for the survival and recruitment of certain tree life-history (or successional) strategies. We investigated whether PyC is correlated with physicochemical soil properties, wood density, aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics and forest resistance to severe drought. To achieve our aim, we used an Amazon-wide, long-term plot network, in forests without known recent fires, integrating site-specific measures of forest dynamics, soil properties and a unique soil PyC concentration database. We found that forests with higher concentrations of soil PyC had both higher soil fertility and lower wood density. Soil PyC was not associated with AGC dynamics in non-drought years. However, during extreme drought events (10% driest years), forests with higher concentrations of soil PyC experienced lower reductions in AGC gains (woody growth and recruitment), with this drought-immunizing effect increasing with drought severity. Forests with a legacy of ancient fires are therefore more likely to continue to grow and recruit under increased drought severity. Forests with high soil PyC concentrations (third quartile) had 3.8% greater AGC gains under mean drought, but 33.7% greater under the most extreme drought than forests with low soil PyC concentrations (first quartile), offsetting losses of up to 0.68 Mg C ha–1yr–1 of AGC under extreme drought events. This suggests that ancient …",2023,U96921436,"BIRD, JAMES",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
7,HUIPING ZHANG,"Rapid bedrock canyon incision during a mid-Holocene pluvial period, Qilian Shan, China","Located at the transition between monsoon and westerly dominated climate systems, major rivers draining the western Qilian Shan incise deep, narrow canyons into latest Quaternary foreland basin sediments of the Hexi Corridor. Field surveys show that the Beida River incised 135 m at mountain front over the Late Pleistocene and Holocene at an average rate of 0.006 m/yr. A steep knickzone, with 3% slope, initiated at the mountain front and has since retreated 10km upstream. Terrace dating results suggest that this knickzone formed around the mid-Holocene, over a duration of less than 1.5 kyr, during which incision accelerated to at least 0.035 m/yr. These incision rates are much larger than the uplift rate across the North Qilian fault, which suggests a climate-related increase in discharge drove rapid incision over the Holocene and formation of the knickzone. Using the relationship between incision rates and the amount of base level drop, we build a bedrock and foreland incision model for the Beida River system. We find that narrowing of channel width plays a key role, as important as increased channel slope, in enhancing the rate of river incision. Our model places the maximum duration of knickzone formation to about 600yr, and the minimum river discharge needed to trigger knickzone formation to be 1.7 times of the present discharge. This period of increased river discharge corresponds to a pluvial lake-filling event at the terminus of the Beida River and correlates with a wet period driven by strengthening of the Southeast Asian Monsoon.",2022,U01550658,"ZHANG, HUIPING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
8,YUAN SUN,Chex: Channel exploration for cnn model compression,"Channel pruning has been broadly recognized as an effective technique to reduce the computation and memory cost of deep convolutional neural networks. However, conventional pruning methods have limitations in that: they are restricted to pruning process only, and they require a fully pre-trained large model. Such limitations may lead to sub-optimal model quality as well as excessive memory and training cost. In this paper, we propose a novel Channel Exploration methodology, dubbed as CHEX, to rectify these problems. As opposed to pruning-only strategy, we propose to repeatedly prune and regrow the channels throughout the training process, which reduces the risk of pruning important channels prematurely. More exactly: From intra-layer's aspect, we tackle the channel pruning problem via a well-known column subset selection (CSS) formulation. From inter-layer's aspect, our regrowing stages open a path for dynamically re-allocating the number of channels across all the layers under a global channel sparsity constraint. In addition, all the exploration process is done in a single training from scratch without the need of a pre-trained large model. Experimental results demonstrate that CHEX can effectively reduce the FLOPs of diverse CNN architectures on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and 3D vision. For example, our compressed ResNet-50 model on ImageNet dataset achieves 76% top-1 accuracy with only 25% FLOPs of the original ResNet-50 model, outperforming previous state-of-the-art channel pruning methods. The checkpoints and code are available at …",2022,U93745903,"SUN, YUAN",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)
9,YUAN SUN,Multi-dimensional model compression of vision transformer,"Vision transformers (ViT) have recently attracted considerable attentions, but the huge computational cost remains an issue for practical deployment. Previous ViT pruning methods tend to prune the model along one dimension solely, which may suffer from excessive reduction and lead to sub-optimal model quality. In contrast, we advocate a multi-dimensional ViT compression paradigm, and propose to harness the redundancy reduction from attention head, neuron and sequence dimensions jointly. We firstly propose a statistical dependence based pruning criterion that is generalizable to different dimensions for identifying deleterious components. Moreover, we cast the multi-dimensional compression as an optimization, learning the optimal pruning policy across the three dimensions that maximizes the compressed model's accuracy under a computational budget. The problem is solved by our adapted Gaussian …",2022,U93745903,"SUN, YUAN",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)
10,YUAN SUN,Multi-dimensional dynamic model compression for efficient image super-resolution,"Modern single image super-resolution (SR) system based on convolutional neural networks achieves substantial progress. However, most SR deep networks are computationally expensive and require excessively large activation memory footprints, impeding their effective deployment to resource-limited devices. Based on the observation that the activation patterns in SR networks exhibit high input-dependency, we propose Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Model Compression method that can reduce both spatial and channel wise redundancy in an SR deep network for different input images. To reduce the spatial-wise redundancy, we propose to perform convolution on scaled-down feature-maps where the down-scaling factor is made adaptive to different input images. To reduce the channel-wise redundancy, we introduce a low-cost channel saliency predictor for each convolution to dynamically skip the computation of unimportant channels based on the Gumbel-Softmax. To better capture the feature-maps information and facilitate input-adaptive decision, we employ classic image processing metrics, eg, Spatial Information, to guide the saliency predictors. The proposed method can be readily applied to a variety of SR deep networks and trained end-to-end with standard super-resolution loss, in combination with a sparsity criterion. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce the FLOPs of both lightweight and non-compact SR models with negligible PSNR loss. Moreover, our compressed models achieve competitive PSNR-FLOPs Pareto frontier compared with SOTA NAS-based SR methods.",2022,U93745903,"SUN, YUAN",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)

13,KARSTEN LUNZE,Factors Related to Smoking and Perceptions of a Behavioral Counseling and Messenger Service–Delivered Smoking Cessation Intervention for People With HIV in China: Qualitative Study,"Background: China, where half of the adult male population smoke tobacco, has one of the highest global burdens of smoking. Smoking rates are even higher among people with HIV. People with HIV can be affected by smoking in multiple ways, including more severe HIV-related symptoms and worse antiretroviral therapy treatment outcomes. However, smoking cessation services targeted for people with HIV are not routinely integrated into HIV care in China. Given the widespread mobile phone ownership, an exploration of factors related to smoking among people with HIV in China who smoke could inform the design and implementation of mobile smoking cessation interventions that target the needs of this vulnerable population.Objective: This study aims to explore the perspectives of smoking, barriers and facilitators to quitting, and perceptions related to a smoking cessation intervention delivered through behavioral counseling sessions and brief daily messenger service (WeChat)–delivered messages.Methods: We recruited people with HIV from the People’s 4th Hospital of Nanning, Guangxi, China, and conducted semistructured face-to-face interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim in Chinese, and translated into English for data analysis. We conducted a thematic analysis using a codebook, which was guided by a team-based consensus approach to identify 5 main themes. We also explored themes according to the demographic groups.Results: A total of 24 participants were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 37.2 (SD= 13.5) years.

14,GEORGE J MURPHY,Abnormal global longitudinal strain and reduced serum inflammatory markers in cardiac AL amyloidosis patients without significant amyloid fibril deposition,"Background: Cardiac dysfunction in AL amyloidosis is thought to be partly related to the direct impact of AL LCs on cardiomyocyte function, with the degree of dysfunction at diagnosis as a major determinant of clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, mechanisms underlying LC-induced myocardial toxicity are not well understood. We identified gene expression changes correlating with human cardiac cells exposed to a cardiomyopathy-associated κAL LC. We then sought to confirm these findings in a clinical dataset by focusing on clinical parameters associated with the pathways dysregulated at the gene expression level. Upon exposure to a cardiomyopathy-associated κAL LC, cardiac cells exhibited gene expression changes related to myocardial contractile function and inflammation, leading us to hypothesize that there could be clinically detectable changes in GLS on echocardiogram and serum inflammatory markers in patients. Thus, we identified 29 patients with normal IVSd but abnormal cardiac biomarkers suggestive of LC-induced cardiac dysfunction. These patients display early cardiac biomarker staging, abnormal GLS, and significantly reduced serum inflammatory markers compared to patients with clinically evident amyloid fibril deposition. Collectively, our findings highlight early molecular and functional signatures of cardiac AL amyloidosis, with potential impact for developing improved patient biomarkers and novel therapeutics.",2024,U92994809,"MURPHY, GEORGE J",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

A common challenge inside refugee camps is consistent, quality food supply, especially for high-risk groups such as pregnant women. This study assessed nutritional adequacy of standardized food packages distributed by an international refugee management organization to residents of one camp in greater Athens, in 2020. At the time, 892 of residents were consuming these food packages, and 88 pregnant or lactating women registered to receive these food packages.Methods: Observers from an independent nonprofit organization working on food security for refugees analyzed the content of the IOM food pack using 24-hour recall of foods consumed by camp residents, and Nutritics Nutritional Analysis Software5. 0.Results.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the six public and private hospitals in the two districts (Lodhran and Multan) of Punjab, Pakistan. The participants of the study comprised healthcare professionals (registered doctors and nurses) working in the participating hospitals. The findings of the seven-factor measurement model showed that behavioral intention (BI) to mHealth adoption is significantly influenced by performance expectancy (β = 0.504, CR = 5.064, p < 0.05) and self-concept (β = 0.860, CR = 5.968, p < 0.05) about mHealth technologies.

The objectives of this study are to assess undergraduate university students’ knowledge and perceived skills of finding, appraising, and applying electronic health information to health-related problems, as well as to assess the association of eHL with physical, psychological, and emotional self-care. Methods The measurement model, comprising four correlated factors based on the 28 valid items from two reliable and valid tests, the ‘eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS)’ and ‘the self-care assessment tool (SCAT)’, was estimated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) among a sample of 1557 undergraduate university students in Pakistan. Results The mean value of the eHEALS ranges between 2.90 and 3.33, indicating that the majority of the respondents had moderate levels of eHL skills. Female respondents and respondents from urban areas have greater levels of perceived eHL skills compared with their male and rural counterparts. The CFA model fit indices show that the goodness of fit values are acceptable: x2 = 7.727, p = 0.000; RMSEA = 0.065; TLI = 0.930, CFI = 0.936, IFI = 0.936, GFI = 0.890, NFI = 0.928, RFI = 0.920, PGFI = 0.754. Conclusion Electronic health (eHealth) literacy has a strong positive association with physical, psychological, and emotional self-care.

20,JOHN R FINNERTY,"Holobiont transcriptomes for the critically endangered staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) from two environmentally distinct sites on Turneffe Atoll, Belize","Historically, staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) was a preeminent reef-builder in the Caribbean and Tropical Western Atlantic, where it constructed extensive thickets at 5-20 m depth that supported diverse ecosystems and provided coastal populations with food, storm protection, and income from tourism. In recent decades, A. cervicornis declined precipitously, up to 97% in some localities. To reverse its decline, widespread efforts are underway to characterize the phenotypic and genetic diversity of persisting populations with the goal of restoring them to historical levels by out-planting nursery grown specimens. To support this target, we developed transcriptomes for two A. cervicornis populations located in Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, Belize. These populations experience significantly different temperatures, light levels and water currents, and they harbor individuals that differ in key phenotypes. Because differentiating the gene activity of diverse taxa—i.e., coral host, algal photosymbiont, plus associated eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and viruses— is critical to understanding the function of the coral holobiont, we developed a pipeline for parsing transcripts by taxon. Separate transcriptomes for each population contain complete representatives for >96% of 978 conserved metazoan single copy orthologs. The taxonomic breakdown of transcripts differed between sites, with more bacterial transcripts recovered from Calabash Caye and more symbiont transcripts from Blackbird Caye.

However, cell engraftment into the airway epithelium is challenging. Here, we model cell engraftment in vitro using the air–liquid interface (ALI) culture system by injuring well-differentiated CF ALI cultures and delivering non-CF cells at the time of peak injury. Engraftment efficiency was quantified by measuring chimerism by droplet digital PCR and functional ion transport in Ussing chambers. Using this model, we found that human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) engraft more efficiently when they are cultured by conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) culture methods.

24,SARAH FREDERICK,Active tracers for hydraulic control of cooled short circuits,"Commercially-successful geothermal systems require balance between thermal and hydraulic performance. An injector-producer well pair with exceptional hydraulic performance, for instance, may have inadequate thermal performance if the effective heat transfer surface area is insufficient. In such a circumstance the current state-of-the-art is to abandon such well pairs once production well temperatures fall below design/operating criteria. Here, an “active” tracer is introduced as a novel solution that enables cooled “short circuits” to be sealed off and circulating fluids to be redirected to hotter flow paths. This treatment increases the effective heat transfer area and subsequently improves thermal performance by increasing production well temperatures. The basic principle is introduced and the anticipated improvement to thermal performance is determined from a hypothetical case in which inlet-outlet short-circuiting causes rapid thermal breakthrough in a non-uniform, two-dimensional fracture. Finally, progress on the development of the active tracer is given.",2023,U03398151,"FREDERICK, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

The concentrated polymer solution has a microstructure at the length scale of the flagellar bundle diameter, and a two-fluid model is used to capture its effect on the motion. We investigate the effects of viscoelasticity, shear thinning, and yield stress combined with microstructure on the swimming motion of a bacterium. We find that, at small polymer concentrations and relaxation times, the enhancement in swimming velocity, observed in several experiments, predominantly arises from the microstructure in the medium. For fluids with finite yield stresses, a larger resistance to motion results in smaller steady swimming velocities compared to those in fluids with no yield stress. It is also observed that, in fluids with a given yield stress, increasing elasticity of the …",2024,U03398151,"FREDERICK, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

To do so, we build and analyze a dynamic general‐equilibrium model of migration that features a rich set of migration motives. We estimate the model to replicate the results of a field experiment that subsidized seasonal migration in rural Bangladesh, leading to significant increases in migration and consumption. We show that the welfare gains from migration subsidies come from providing better insurance for vulnerable rural households rather than from correcting spatial misallocation by relaxing credit constraints for those with high productivity in urban areas that are stuck in rural areas.",2023,U86309545,"LAGAKOS, DAVID",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Granulomatous inflammation is the hallmark of MAC lung infection, yet reliable correlates of disease progression, susceptibility, and resolution are poorly defined. Unlike widely used inbred mouse strains, mice that carry the mutant allele at the genetic locus sst1 develop human-like pulmonary tuberculosis featuring well-organized caseating granulomas. We characterized pulmonary temporospatial outcomes of intranasal and left intrabronchial M. avium spp. hominissuis (M.av) induced pneumonia in B6.Sst1S mice, which carries the sst1 mutant allele. We utilized traditional semi-quantitative histomorphological evaluation, in combination with fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry (fmIHC), whole slide imaging, and quantitative digital image analysis. Followingintrabronchiolar infection with the laboratory M.av strain 101, the B6.Sst1S pulmonary lesions progressed 12–16 weeks post infection (wpi), with plateauing and/or resolving disease by 21 wpi. Caseating granulomas were not observed during the study. Disease progression from 12–16 wpi was associated with increased acid-fast bacilli, area of secondary granulomatous pneumonia lesions, and Arg1+ and double positive iNOS+/Arg1+ macrophages.

34,BRIAN MICHAEL WALSH,Quantifying the global solar wind-magnetosphere interaction with the Solar-Terrestrial Observer for the Response of the Magnetosphere (STORM) mission concept,"Much of what we know about the solar wind’s interaction with the Earth’s magnetosphere has been gained from isolated in-situ measurements by single or multiple spacecraft. Based on their observations, we know that reconnection, whether on the dayside magnetopause or deep within the Earth’s magnetotail, controls the bulk flow of solar wind energy into and through the global system and that nightside activity provides the energized particles that power geomagnetic storms. But by their very nature these isolated in-situ measurements cannot provide an instantaneous global view of the entire system or its cross-scale dynamics. To fully quantify the dynamics of the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere requires comprehensive end-to-end global imaging of the key plasma structures that comprise the magnetosphere which have spatial resolutions that exceeds anything possible with multi-point or constellation situ measurements. Global, end-to-end, imaging provides the pathway to understanding the system as a whole, its constituent parts, and its cross-scale processes on a continuous basis, as needed to quantify the flow of solar wind energy through the global magnetospheric system. This paper describes how a comprehensively-instrumented single spacecraft in a high-altitude, high-inclination orbit coupled with ground-based instruments provides the essential observations needed to track and quantify the flow of solar wind energy through the magnetosphere. This includes observations of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field input, the magnetopause location in soft X-rays, the auroral oval in far ultraviolet, the ring current in energetic …",2023,U84229410,"WALSH, BRIAN MICHAEL",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

In this study we present results from a comparative analysis of 274 magnetic reconnection events as observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to determine what quantities affect the accuracy of such models and are most strongly associated with the occurrence of dayside magnetopause reconnection.

Furthermore, PRIME-SH is shown to reproduce physics not explicitly enforced during training, such as field line draping, the dayside plasma depletion layer, the magnetosheath flow stagnation point, and the Rankine-Hugoniot MHD shock jump conditions. PRIME-SH has the additional benefits of being computationally inexpensive relative to global MHD simulations, being capable of reproducing difficult-to-model physics such as temperature anisotropy, and being capable of reliably estimating its own uncertainty to within .",2024,U84229410,"WALSH, BRIAN MICHAEL",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

However, modeling of magnetosheath conditions is difficult, and most effort is placed on using the upstream solar wind conditions as inputs into models for energy transfer into the magnetosphere. In this study, a probabilistic recurrent neural network is trained to reproduce magnetosheath conditions measured by MMS from measurements of the solar wind far upstream of the Earth and assign physically meaningful uncertainties to its predictions.

Compared to euploid controls, trisomic CS display smaller size, deficient neurogenesis, and AD-related pathological features, such as enhanced cell death and depositions of amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). EV-treated trisomic CS demonstrated preserved size, partial rescue in the production of neurons, significantly decreased levels of Aβ and p-tau, and a reduction in the extent of cell death as compared to the untreated trisomic CS.

It is strongly influenced by under-cloud evaporation in unsaturated air, especially in arid climates. Based on the improved Stewart model, this study used 670 precipitation stable isotope data and measured meteorological element data from 11 sampling points from January 2018 to September 2019 to verify the existence of sub-cloud secondary evaporation in the Shiyang river basin and quantitatively calculate the intensity of sub-cloud secondary evaporation and its influence on precipitation stable isotopes. The study used the vapor flux and the improved Lagrangian model to track the moisture source of precipitation and analyze the influence of the moisture source of different paths on the stable isotopes of precipitation. Therefore, this study is helpful to understand the evapotranspiration loss mechanism and recharge mechanism of moisture in the watershed. The results showed that there is sub-cloud secondary evaporation in the Shiyang River Basin, and from the seasonal scale, the sub-cloud secondary evaporation is stronger in spring and summer, but weaker in autumn and winter, which makes heavy isotopes enriched in spring and summer and depleted in autumn and winter.

Turbulent flow was simulated using large eddy simulation (LES). The sediment particle was simulated using the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM). The interaction forces of turbulent flow and sediment particle were calculated using the immersed boundary method (IBM). It indicated that the collisions of saltating particle with low concentration increase the saltation length and flight time. In response, sediment particle velocity also increases. The particle angular velocity is largest at the takeoff moment, and decreases gradually in the saltation progress. The drag and lift forces near the bed are large, and away from the bed decrease and trend to be a stable value, gradually. From the relative magnitudes of the drag and lift forces, the lift force plays a more important role than the drag force in the sediment saltation. The relative magnitudes of drag and lift forces influence the incident and takeoff angles.

62,CATHERINE ESPAILLAT,Lyα Scattering Models Trace Accretion and Outflow Kinematics in T Tauri Systems,"T Tauri stars produce broad Lyα emission lines that contribute∼ 88% of the total UV flux incident on the inner circumstellar disks. Lyα photons are generated at the accretion shocks and in the protostellar chromospheres and must travel through accretion flows, winds, and jets, the protoplanetary disks, and the interstellar medium before reaching the observer. This trajectory produces asymmetric, double-peaked features that carry kinematic and opacity signatures of the disk environments. To understand the link between the evolution of Lyα emission lines and the disks themselves, we model HST-COS spectra from targets included in Data Release 3 of the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards program.

Extreme heat, extended freeze, excessive precipitation, and/or prolong drought impacts neighborhoods disproportionately across heterogenous urban geographies. Underserved, underrepresented, and marginalized communities are more likely to bear the burden of increased exposure to adverse climate impacts while simultaneously facing power asymmetries in access to the policy and knowledge production process. Knowledge co-production is one framework that seeks to address this convergence of disproportionate climate impact exposure and disenfranchised communities. Co-production is increasingly used in sustainability and resilience research to ask questions and develop solutions with, by, and for those communities that are most impacted. By weaving research, planning, evaluation, and policy in an iterative cycle, knowledge and action can be more closely coupled. However, the practice of co-production often lacks reflexivity in ways that can transform the science and policy of urban resilience to address equity more directly.

However, current methods to estimate event-specific compound flooding at the household level require high-performance computing resources frequently not available to local stakeholders. Government and non-governmental agencies currently lack the methods to repeatedly and rapidly create flood impact maps that incorporate the local variability in both hazards and social vulnerability. We address this gap by developing a methodology to estimate a flood impact index at the household level in near-real time, utilizing high-resolution elevation data to approximate event-specific inundation from both pluvial and fluvial sources in conjunction with a social vulnerability index. Our analysis uses the 2015 Memorial Day flood in Austin, Texas, as a case study and proof of concept for our methodology. We show that 37 % of the census block groups in the study area experience flooding from only pluvial sources and are not identified in local or national flood hazard maps as being at risk. Furthermore, averaging hazard estimates to cartographic boundaries masks household variability, with 60 % of the census block groups in the study area having a coefficient of variation around the mean flood depth exceeding 50 %. Comparing our pluvial flooding estimates to a 2D physics-based model, we classify household impact accurately for 92 % of households.

Surface deposition changes in response to sea‐level rise (SLR) and sediment supply, but it remains unclear how these surface changes affect the distribution and transport of groundwater solutes in aquifers. Here, we explore the influence of SLR and sediment supply on aquifer heterogeneity and resulting effects on contaminant transport.

Given this uncertainty, numerical modeling is needed to explore how different SLR projections may impact river delta evolution. In this work, we apply the pyDeltaRCM numerical model to simulate 350 years of deltaic evolution under three different SLR trajectories: steady rise, an abrupt change in SLR rate, and a gradual acceleration of SLR. For each SLR trajectory, we test a set of six final SLR magnitudes between 5 and 40 mm/yr, in addition to control runs with no SLR.

Thus, quantifying the spatiotemporal variability of the flow velocity field is essential for forecasting their fate. To calibrate/validate models, field measurements alone are not sufficient because such data only characterize the hydrodynamic conditions in localized areas. Remote sensing has potential to fill this data gap.

84,PAULA AUSTIN,Impacts of human modifications on material transport in deltas,"As humans continue to inhabit and modify river deltas, the natural processes governing material transport through these landscapes are altered. Two common engineering projects undertaken on deltas are the dredging of channels to enable shipping and the construction of embankments to reduce flooding. While the impact of these topographic modifications has been studied at a local-level for specific sites, there is a gap in our generalized understanding of how these landscape modifications impact material transport. To narrow this gap, we conduct exploratory numerical modeling to develop deltaic landscapes with different input sediment compositions, modify their topography to mimic dredging and embankments, simulate different flow conditions, and then model the transport of passive particles. We find that human modification of topography lowers hydrological connectivity by reducing the area visited by fluvial inputs. The amount of time particles spend within the delta is reduced by the construction of polders and is lengthened by dredging. Material buoyancy has a greater impact on nourishment areas and exposure times than flow regime or topographic modification, with positively-buoyant particles spending longer and visiting a greater area of the delta than neutral and negatively-buoyant material.

The exclusion of topographic depressions, and therefore pluvial flooding, from leading flood hazard maps is also underestimating potential exposure. Furthermore, national level exploratory analyses have yet to capture local variability in exposure and social vulnerability, which is necessary for local stakeholders to identify the inequitable distribution of flood risks. Using high resolution elevation data to approximate event specific inundation from both pluvial and fluvial sources, in conjunction with a localized social vulnerability index, we created a methodology to estimate flood risk at the household level. Our analysis uses the 2015 Memorial Day Flood in Austin, Texas as a case study and proof of concept of our estimation methodology. We show that the inclusion of pluvial flood sources increases inundation extents, with 37% of the Census Block Groups in the study area experiencing flooding from only pluvial sources. Furthermore, averaging flood depths, and therefore exposure estimates, to geographical and cartographic boundaries (e.g., Census Block Groups), masks household variability, with 80% of the Census Block Groups in the study area having a coefficient of variation around the mean flood depth exceeding 100%.

Floodplain width can also vary along a river, and floodplain constrictions in the form of bluffs adjacent to the river can influence inundation extent. However, the relative controls of backwater-influenced floodplain topography and bluff topography on river-floodplain connectivity have not been studied. We measure discharge along the lower Trinity River (Texas, USA) during high flow to determine which floodplain features are associated with major river-floodplain flow exchanges. We develop a numerical model representing the transition to backwater-dominated river hydraulics, and quantify downstream changes in levee channelization, inundation, and fluxes along the river-floodplain boundary. We model passive particle transport through the floodplain, and compute residence times as a function of location where particles enter the floodplain. We find that bluff topography controls flow from the floodplain back to the river, whereas levee topography facilitates flow to the floodplain through floodplain channels. Return flow to the river is limited to locations just upstream of bluffs, even under receding flood conditions, whereas outflow locations are numerous and occur all along the river. Residence times for particles entering the floodplain far upstream of bluffs are as much as two orders of magnitude longer than those for particles entering short distances upstream of bluffs.

For instance, given ""Toronto is located in [MASK]."", we want to test whether a more specific answer will be better filled in by PLMs, e.g., Ontario instead of Canada. From our evaluations, we show that existing PLMs have only a slight preference for more specific answers. We identify underlying factors affecting the specificity and design two prompt-based methods to improve the specificity. Results show that the specificity of the models can be improved by the proposed methods without additional training. We hope this work can bring to awareness the notion of specificity of language models and encourage the research community to further explore this important but understudied problem.",2022,U70067037,"CHANG, KEVIN",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

However, previous studies have primarily relied on word dictionaries with a limited number of food words and employed common-sense categorizations to determine the healthiness of those words. To enhance the analysis of the urban food environment using LBSM data, it is crucial to develop a more comprehensive list of food-related words. Within the context, this study delves into the exploration of expanding food-related words along with their associated energy densities.This study addresses the aforementioned research gap by introducing a novel methodology for expanding the food-related word dictionary and predicting energy densities.

However, this has been accompanied by increased pollutant emissions and sacrificed environment quality (Zhou et al. 2019). In the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, China ranked 120th in overall environmental performance. In terms of air quality, China ranked fourth from last due to its ill performance in the evaluation of PM2. 5.

This paper focuses on income inequality in developing countries, particularly LDCs. First, we demonstrate the infeasibility of fiscal measures in resolving income inequality even in developed countries. Second, we show that inequality in LDCs can be largely explained by urban-rural gap. Third, we uncover the benign impacts of urbanization on urban-rural gap. This leads us to propose an out-of-box strategy—containing income inequality by promoting well-managed urbanization. Fourth, we reveal a misperception that may have contributed to the neglect of urban-rural gap in constituting national inequality.

This paper uses spatial models to analyze the impact and mechanism of producer services agglomeration on carbon efficiency of manufacturing industry based on the data from 286 prefecture-level cities and above in China. As urban spatial agglomeration is strongly influenced by the land-use policy and characterized by variegated degrees of industrial agglomeration, it shows various carbon efficiencies in China’s context. The results indicate that urban producer services agglomeration has both direct and indirect positive effects on carbon efficiency of manufacturing industry, whilst the indirect spillover effects have prominent spatial attenuation characteristics with an effective boundary of 350 kilometers. Moreover, the agglomeration of low-end producer services shows a significant positive indirect effect on carbon efficiency, whilst the high-end has both …",2022,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

In this study, a conceptual framework is developed to identify cities with mismatched land development and applied to solicit those out of 615 Chinese cities in 2008–2017 – a decade after the global financial crisis (GFC). The results indicate that, although the urban expansion impacted economic recovery after the GFC in the short term, the lack of actual demand from the population and industries caused the mismatched land development in the long term, with the most mismatched cities clustered in the northeast and northwest regions in China. In the post-GFC era, the increasing financial dependence of local governments on urban land profits accelerated the mismatched land …",2022,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Recourse to traditional welfare theory or Amartya Sen's function and ability welfare theory is inappropriate in this situation as neither is focused on the influence of welfare differences. Therefore, this study aims to provide a new focus for welfare economics in integrating the concept of the internal group welfare gap into overall welfare evaluation. Fuzzy mathematics is applied to calculate welfare and the concept of the Gini coefficient is used to evaluate the welfare gap. The resulting model is applied to the cities of Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Wuxi before and after rural residential land circulation (RRLC) to determine their resulting changes in welfare and welfare gap. From this, it is found that, after RRLC, the farmers' overall welfare increased by 17.5%, 15.1%, and 23.5 …",2022,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Several modes and approaches have been applied to remake space in rural China, which differ greatly in restructuring outcomes. In response, this article builds on the insights of regime theory to develop a conceptual framework to reveal the mechanism behind China's rural spatial restructuring and seeks to explore the underlying reasons that affect the outcomes. It is found that resource adequacy, the quality of resource coalition, and the effectiveness of implementation determine the rural regime's capacity to manage spatial restructuring. Case studies from Hua County, Chaohu City, and Shenzhen are used to illustrate the conceptual framework's application and facilitate a comparative analysis from the perspective of rural regime capacity.

The low-carbon city pilots (LCCPs) policy in China is a demonstration of how state power intervenes and commands national low-carbon development through voluntary policy tools. Our study, based on panel data of 331 cities from 2005 to 2019, evaluates the policy effect of all three batches of LCCPs and presents an analysis of time-varying effects through batch decomposition and synthetic difference-in-difference models. The study found that implementing low-carbon policies can significantly reduce total carbon emissions and carbon emissions per capita. However, the reduction in carbon emissions per unit of GDP is insignificant, and the policy effect varies according to the batches and their characteristics. The reduction effects in the first and second batches, as …",2023,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

However, assessing their decarbonization levels with internationally recognized metrics such as the OECD cities’ criteria is a major challenge, as the fuzzy definitions of China’s cities – including by city administrative boundary (UB1), city district boundary (UB2), and urban built-up area (UB3) – create misconceptions and ambiguities over the integrity and accuracy of their reported emissions. In this study, we develop a new China high-resolution emission database (CHRED) as a means of quantifying urban emissions based on dynamic city limits defined by population density boundary (UB4). Employing a 1 km grid dataset built from point-emission sources, it is showed that: (1) the reported emissions from the adoption of different urban boundaries can have …",2022,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

This paper investigates how the marginal abatement cost (MAC) is changed by the China CETS from a perspective of alternative allowance allocation methods. The empirical strategy adopts the directional distance function and difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, coupled with the industry-by-province level data from 2008 to 2016. The roles of free-auction combined allowance allocation rules and free allocation in the MAC are explored.

Understanding household characteristics is essential in exploring potential strategies to decouple carbon emissions from the increasing consumption. In this study, we utilized the multi-region input-output (MRIO) method to calculate household carbon emissions in China for the years 2012, 2016, and 2018. Using micro-level household survey data, we identified variations in carbon emissions among households with different economic levels and socioeconomic characteristics. Our analysis revealed that changes in household consumption structure and carbon intensity among households with improved economic levels, could result in a reduction of carbon emissions by 14 % to 19 %.

However, our empirical work shows that households with demolition of their homes do not necessarily have negative life satisfaction by drawing from a sample of 9173 households in the baseline survey of the China Family Panel Studies. These findings are robust to model misspecification. We also investigated the mechanisms involved and underscore that housing demolition increases the quality of household accommodation on the one hand (positive effect) while decreasing household social connection and occupational stability on the other (negative effect). The lack of significant correlation between demolition and life satisfaction may therefore be attributable to the positive and negative effects of housing demolition on their life …",2023,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) is a method to combine the value of ecosystem services and can reflect the status of ecosystem and ecological conservation and restoration performance. The conservation and restoration of desert ecosystems play an important role in expanding global cultivated land, ensuring food security, and improving human wellbeing. However, ecosystem services and the value of GEP in deserts have been neglected. Taking the Kubuqi Desert ecosystem as an example, this study evaluated the pattens, GEP value, and its change in the Kubuqi Desert ecosystem from 2000 to 2020. Our study found that 1) over the past 20 years, the areas of wetlands, forests, grasslands, and shrubs in the Kubuqi desert ecosystem had increased by 100.65%, 6.05%, 2.24%, and 2.03%, respectively, while that of desert had decreased by 10.62%; 2) the GEP of Kubuqi in 2020 was 55.48 billion CNY, among which its sandstorm prevention value was the highest (39.39%); 3) The value of ecosystem services in the Kubuqi desert ecosystem were all increased over the 20-year period and the largest increase came from sandstorm prevention (increased by 195.09%). This study emphasizes how GEP accounting can promote desert conservation and restoration, quantifies the contribution of desert ecosystems to human wellbeing, and provides future GEP accounting suggestions for desert ecosystems.

To better understand how root symbiotic fungi (ectomycorrhizal fungi, EMF) will react to an increase in atmospheric CO2 we’ve simulated such scenario using synthetic ecosystems where pine trees were planted with and without their EMF (Suillus cothurnatus), nitrogen (N), and soil carbon (C) additions, in elevated vs ambient CO2 growth chambers. By combining biogeochemical analysis with differential isotopic signatures of soil vs plant C, and a series of -omic approaches, we captured changes in soil nutrients, soil respiration, and microbial composition and activity. We found that elevated CO2 did not lead to a change in free living fungal community composition compared to ambient CO2. However, under elevated CO2, more gene modules of S. cothurnatus involved in C-N degradation pathways were impacted by soil C and N additions. In turn, under elevated CO2 and when the EMF was present, we found high enrichment of non-targeted metabolites. The release of CO2 from soil was highly dependent on soil C and N availability and shifted depending on plant C availability. Our results inform ecosystem models by showing that interactions between free living fungi and EMF are an important mechanism for determining ecosystem responses to elevated CO2. In turn, our results challenge the classic perspective that EMF solely absorb nutrients and water and give them to plants.",2023,U59756288,"BHATNAGAR, JENNIFER MARIE",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

We aimed to test the hypothesis that incorporating microbial community composition into linear models will increase the variation explained in forest soil N and P cycling relative to models including only plant community and abiotic characteristics. To do this, we designed a forested field system in New England in which variation in microbial community composition was crossed with variation in vegetation composition and soil nutrient content. At six forest sites (three suburban and three rural sites), we sampled soil along a transect from the forest edge to interior from four stand types dominated by trees of varying litter quality: pine-dominated, pure hardwood, hardwood with pines in the understory, and mature mixed pine-hardwood.

We also performed high-throughput sequencing of fungal and bacterial rDNA amplicons (16S/ITS) and calculated functional guild abundance for fungi and bacteria in each sample. Excluding microbial factors, N mineralization was best explained in a linear model by pH, soil temperature, soil moisture, % soil organic matter, and the abundance of understory vegetation; nitrification was best explained by pH, the proportion of hardwood litter, the abundance of understory vegetation, and basal area of arbuscular mycorrhizal …",2023,U59756288,"BHATNAGAR, JENNIFER MARIE",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

158,LUIS E CARVALHO,Assessment of soil physical quality and water flow regulation under straw removal Management in Sugarcane Production Fields,"Removing sugarcane straw to increase bioenergy production can generate significant income to the industry. However, straw contributes to the regulation of soil functions and consequently supports the provision of ecosystem services, such as water flow regulation. Thus, straw removal may hinder the provision of these services, especially in mechanized sugarcane production systems, which have soil compaction problems due to machinery traffic. In this study, we assess a six-year experiment in Brazil with four rates of straw removal: 0 Mg ha−1 (TR), 5 Mg ha−1 (HR), 10 Mg ha−1 (LR), and 15 Mg ha−1 (NR) remaining straw. Using attributes, such as soil bulk density, porosity, water infiltration, runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity and available water-holding capacity, as indicators of key soil functions, we calculated a soil-related ecosystem service (ES) index for water flow regulation provision. The ES index revealed that water flow regulation was low regardless of the straw management (0.56, 0.63, 0.64 and 0.60 for TR, HR, LR and NR, respectively). It can be a consequence of soil compaction caused by machinery traffic throughout the successive cycle, whose straw was unable to mitigate this issue. Thus, by the end of the sugarcane cycle (sixth ratoon), straw removal had little effect on soil physical and hydraulic indicators, and consequently had little impact on the provision of the soil-related ES associated with water flow regulation. Nevertheless, straw management should be planned to consider other functions and soil-related ES benefited by straw retention.",2022,U56647543,"CARVALHO, LUIS E",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
159,LUIS E CARVALHO,"Stabilization of organic matter in soils: drivers, mechanisms, and analytical tools–a literature review","Soils are the largest terrestrial carbon (C) reservoir, and most of this C is retained as soil organic matter (SOM). Due to its ability to capture, stabilize, and store C for extended periods, soils are considered important allies in decarbonizing the atmosphere. The term ‘C stabilization’ includes a series of mechanisms or processes by which soil C is protected within soils and its losses are reduced through microbial decomposition or leaching. Due to their relevance in the global C cycle, C stabilization mechanisms have received intensive attention from the scientific community. As new analytic technologies push the boundaries of what was previously possible to know, new paradigms emerge. This literature review summarizes the current knowledge of the main mechanisms that may promote SOM stabilization. Factors that govern accumulation of SOM are also addressed. We highlight the role of organo-mineral associations and spatial inaccessibility of SOM due to occlusion within soil aggregates to understand the relative contribution of these mechanisms in different soil conditions (e.g., soil texture, mineralogy, and land- use). In addition, the contribution of cutting-edge approaches and analytical techniques to advance the understanding of SOM protection is presented. Modern techniques to evaluate SOM on a micro, nano, and molecular scale can contribute to the mechanistic understanding of SOM stabilization and the study and adoption of management strategies that maintain and increase C stocks in soils.",2023,U56647543,"CARVALHO, LUIS E",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Deep venous thrombosis is a common complication in cancer survivors and can be potentially fatal. The current murine venous thrombosis models typically involve a complete or partial mechanical occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) using a suture. This procedure induces a total or partial stasis of blood and endothelial damage, triggering thrombogenesis.

Using a syngeneic colon cancer xenograft mouse model, we employed customized vascular clips to ligate the infrarenal vena cava. These clips allow residual lip space similar to a 5-0 polypropylene suture after IVC ligations. Mice with the suture method served as controls. The vascular clip method resulted in a consistent reproducible partial vascular occlusion and greater clot weights with less variability than the suture method. The larger clot weights, greater clot mass, and clot to the IVC luminal surface area were expected due to the higher pressure profile of the vascular clips compared to a 6-0 polypropylene suture.

Socioeconomic consequences may be particularly disruptive in the occurrence of abrupt climate change. Understanding the response of tropical precipitation to abrupt climate change is a crucial task for improving future projections and devising adaptation policies. Past abrupt climate change events such as the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) cycles may provide relevant insights regarding the dynamics of the climate system under this type of climate change. Here we present a paleoceanographic reconstruction off NE Brazil based on geochemical analyses (stable oxygen isotopes, Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca) performed in planktonic foraminifera, that focus on DO stadials of Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5, 130–71 ka). Our new Ba/Ca record shows increases in fluvial discharge linked to enhanced continental precipitation over NE Brazil during DO stadials of MIS5. Tropical precipitation patterns were altered with enhanced rainfall in NE Brazil during DO stadials as a consequence of a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which, in turn, was likely a response to changes in ocean heat transport and sea ice cover, as highlighted by recent climate model simulations. The results presented here provide useful information on how abrupt climate change can impact tropical rainfall, which is crucial for tropical societies in order to delineate strategies to cope with future climate change.",2022,U40718334,"ALBUQUERQUE, ANA",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)

Geological records show that the transition between these equilibrium states caused significant long‐term eustatic sea‐level and atmospheric CO2 decline paced by external orbital motions. Such eustatic variability influenced the stacking pattern of sedimentary successions, generating cyclic sequence boundaries that may be globally correlated. However, the impact of such oscillation along the Brazilian margin is largely unknown.

191,ANA ALBUQUERQUE,Attenuation of wind intensities exacerbates anoxic conditions leading to sulfur plume development off the coast of Peru,"The release of vast quantities of sulfide from the sediment into the water column, known as a sulfidic event, has detrimental consequences on fish catches, including downstream effects on other linked element cycles. Despite being frequent occurrences in marine upwelling regions, our understanding of the factors that moderate sulfidic event formation and termination are still rudimentary. Here, we examined the biogeochemical and hydrodynamic conditions that underpinned the formation/termination of one of the largest sulfur plumes to be reported in the Peruvian upwelling zone. Consistent with previous research, we find that the sulfur-rich plume arose during the austral summer when anoxic conditions (i.e., oxygen and nitrate depletion) prevailed in waters overlying the upper shelf. Furthermore, the shelf sediments were organically charged and characterized by low iron-bound sulfur concentrations, further enabling the diffusion of benthic-generated sulfide into the water column. While these biogeochemical conditions provided a predicate to sulfidic event formation, we highlight that attenuations in local wind intensity served as an event trigger. Namely, interruptions in local wind speed constrained upwelling intensity, causing increased stratification over the upper shelf. Moreover, disturbances in local wind patterns likely placed additional constraints on wind-driven mesoscale eddy propagation, with feedback effects on coastal elemental sulfur plume (ESP) formation. We suggest ESP development occurs as a result of a complex interaction of biogeochemistry with regional hydrodynamics.",2023,U40718334,"ALBUQUERQUE, ANA",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)
192,ANA ALBUQUERQUE,"Preservation Factors during Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Events in the Espírito Santo Basin, Southeast Brazil","The oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are characterized by enhanced accumulation of organic matter in marine sediments. However, there is still an ongoing debate regarding the interplay between production and preservation during these events. Moreover, few studies provide quantitative estimations of primary productivity and/or the amount of carbon preserved during the OAEs. Here, we used geochemical data from multiple wells located at the Espírito Santo Basin that cover the intervals of events OAE1d and OAE2 to provide quantitative estimates of preservation factors. Our results show enhanced preservation during OAEs compared to modern conditions and a stronger preservation during OAE1d compared to OAE2 in the Espírito Santo Basin. The amount of preserved carbon could reach up to 8.6% during OAE1d, depending on the productivity of the system. In addition, we show that such improvement in preservation is linked to the bottom water with low-O2 concentrations and not due to fast burial caused by high sedimentation rates. Our findings are extremally relevant for organic carbon and source rock modelling studies since model simulations need quantitative estimations.",2022,U40718334,"ALBUQUERQUE, ANA",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)

Long-term proxy records could help understand the impact of elevated CO2 on tropical vegetation. We provide observationally inferred evidence that the evolution of the Atlantic Forest in SE Brazil between~ 150 and 65 ka was influenced by CO2 variability rather than temperature or precipitation on both precessional and millennial time scales. Plant wax n-alkanes in a marine core were used to trace forest cover fluctuations and compared with continental records of fossil pollen, revealing a strong correlation with CO2 levels. This highlights CO2 fertilization as a key driver of the past Atlantic Forest evolution, emphasizing the need for protection initiatives to preserve its long-term capacity in carbon storage.

Food connects us to the land, oceans and sky that sustain us, as well as to our cultures. Food helps us know where we are from,‘who we are’and to ‘feel good about ourselves’[2]. Community is the level of society where food-related connections to people and place occur. As such, community needs to be at the centre of future food systems in the same way food markets are at the centre of our villages, towns and cities. Increased interaction between farmers and consumers may help to achieve more environmentally sustainable food supply chains [3]. It may also reduce the stranglehold that global food manufacturers have on food supply and decrease the supply of ultra-processed foods [4].

220,HUA WANG,Oxide-Metal Hybrid Glass Nanomembranes with Exceptional Thermal Stability,"Contrary to oxide or polymeric glasses, metallic glasses are infamously known for their relatively limited thermal stability, which is often characterized by their narrow supercooled liquid regions. Nonetheless, we successfully fabricated metallic-glass based nanomembranes with an ultrahigh thermal ability by a polymer surface buckling enabled exfoliation technique. These nanomembranes exhibit a distinctive nanostructure with nanosized metallic-glasses encapsulated within an interconnected nanoamorphous-oxide network. Due to a pronounced nanoconfinement effect, crystallization is significantly suppressed. Consequently, these oxidized metallic-glass nanomembranes initiate a glass transition at 324 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min. Remarkably, they also showcase an expansive supercooled liquid region of 448 K, surpassing various metallic and oxide glasses reported. Furthermore, these nanomembranes …",2024,U35190453,"WANG, HUA",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
221,HUA WANG,Transport of Volatiles in Agglutinates from Lunar Regolith of Chang’E-5 Mission,"Volatiles transport in the lunar regolith is essential for lunar soil evolution and in-situ resources utilization (ISRU) and has not been fully understood. Here, we characterize a typical agglutinate particle from Chang’E-5 samples and demonstrate the transport behavior of volatiles through the porous structure. The results of surface and 3D structural characterization indicate that the formation of the smooth porous structure is mainly caused by volatiles flow. Based on the element distribution analysis, we further speculate the main component of the volatiles is gas water attributed to the reduction of FeO by abundant hydrogen in the superficial lunar regolith during micrometeoroids impacts. Numerical models of volatiles (gas water) transport in the porous agglutinate have been developed for different pressure conditions. The results show the ultrafast transport of volatiles makes the superficial regolith dry and barren under high-vacuum condition. We conclude that rapid escape of volatiles can hardly retain water in the superficial lunar soil yet provides opportunities for development of ISRU technology.",2023,U35190453,"WANG, HUA",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

These vehicles pose a significant demand for liquid fuels, which is typically met by fossil fuels whose combustion is known to exacerbate the climate crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the energy industry, particularly the transportation sector (aviation, maritime, and road transport), largely because of travel restrictions globally.

229,JOSEPH H KAHN,Simulating potential associated socio-economic determinants with sustainable food security (a macro-Micro spatial quantitative model),"Improving sustainable food security status, nowadays, is an important challenge globally, especially in developing countries. The policy goal should be equity—everyone has the same opportunity to be food secure—rather than equality—everyone gets the same subsidy. Since the culture and socioeconomic status within a country vary from region to region, collapsing all areas into a unique region may introduce errors and inaccurate results, as most studies carried out. This study assesses the geographical pattern of association between food security and socioeconomic factors in urban areas in Iran using a nationally and regionally representative household consumption-expenditure survey from 2010 to 2018. The logistic regression model and big data are used to achieve this goal. The results show that a substantial number of households face food insecurity in urban areas in Iran. Also, different geographic regions have various salient factors that affect food insecurity. Aggregation tests confirmed that researchers should estimate separate models for different provinces, states, and districts to assess and monitor the food security status of a country instead of estimating a unique model for the whole of the country. Geographical disparities should be considered as an important issue before suggesting any catch-all policies for a country. The geo-locational factor of households is a key determinant of the association between socioeconomic factors and food security in urban areas in Iran. In sum, the practical suggestions for improving Iranian households' food security in urban areas are as follows: (1) Developing job opportunities for the head of …",2022,U17693059,"KAHN, JOSEPH H",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

In order to assess the impact of BRI using consequentialist logic, it is desirable to have model-based counterfactual results. This paper is a first step in that direction. Aggregate consequences for the Chinese economy in terms of economic growth, output and employment impacts are estimated for two BRI scenarios—a high investment and demand scenario and the current low investment and demand scenario. Some important dynamic econometric issues are discussed in an appendix. Also, a more complex economic systems model with explicit banking and financial sectors for the Chinese economy is presented for further, more sophisticated modeling work. As a first approximation, the current modeling results show that BRI will certainly not harm the Chinese economy; but the low demand scenario does not translate into great gains either. The high demand longer term scenario is much more attractive for the economic policymakers in China. However, even in that instance the economic consequences alone cannot justify the strategic importance given to BRI by the Chinese rulers. One possible conclusion is that the geopolitical motives are the main drivers of BRI with modest prospects of economic gains but real prospects of energy security and overall trade and investment security.

Using the ideas of disorder at the micro level and the emergence of order at the macro level out of this disorder, the capitalist order/disorder dynamics in the developing economies is explored theoretically and empirically. The classical idea of real competition  can be used to explore how a crisis-ridden dynamics of uneven development emerges particularly for the DEs as part of the GCO dynamics. Some limits of policies and of the so-called developmental state capacities can be identified through this analysis.  A related purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of industrialization and development with equity in the 21st century with an emphasis on rapidly growing developing economies in the global system such as the BRICS . The formal nonlinear model presented in the appendix may be seen as an initial step to put the analysis within a complex economic systems framework. Real competition and relative surplus value extraction play critical conceptual roles in this complex dynamic process.   China is selected from among the BRICS as a special case study of DEs. More specifically, the complex dynamics underlying the relative surplus value extraction is explored in the context of growth, inequality and poverty.

At least three issues require sustained analysis. These are: 1. Trade, investment and growth prospects both in PRC and other countries, but particularly in the Global South;  2. Distributional issues and the possibilities of advancing arrangements that can enhance people’s well-being in various BRI countries;  3. The geopolitical consequences and how to avoid a new cold war. On the trade and investment side, BRI promises to create a multilateral trading and investment area under Chinese leadership. Both preexisting US hostility and fears generated by such prospects summed up under the paranoid term “China’s Sharp Power”, have given BRI a bad press in the west in the absence of any model-based scientific analysis. In order to assess the impact of BRI using consequentialist logic, it is desirable to have model-based counterfactual results.

Accordingly, I try to find a way to integrate useful markets with the key characteristics of the Enabling Ecological Developmental State(EEDS) for the 21st Century in order to build a growing ecologically sustainable economy with equity in terms of capabilities.

We aim for   theoretical clarification as well as for aiding the strategies of popular democratic movements. A few tentative steps are taken here to serve this dual purpose. Proceeding from a critical capabilities perspective that is fully grounded in social reality of deepening structural and ecological crises of the Global Capitalist System, we discover that such a perspective leads to the need to include among the characteristics of the Enabling Ecological Developmental State for the 21st Century its capacity to build an ecologically sustainable egalitarian development strategy from the beginning.

236,JOSEPH H KAHN,Dedollarization: The Role of Expanded BRICS and the Global South,"Dedollarization is accelerating. Inter alia, the US-led western sanctions have accelerated the thinking about dedollarization and some tentative actions in the BRICS countries in particular. Further expansion of BRICS has strengthened these tendencies. With support from the other countries in the Global South, dedollarization will receive continuing impetus.    It is one of the main theses of this paper that eventually the US will be forced to settle down to its substantial but reduced role in the Global Economy while a multipolar order replaces the brief ---in historical terms--- the dollar-based US hegemony during the cold war and dollar dominance during the unipolar two decades from 1991 to 2010. However, the pace of this evolution will depend on international politics and strategic foreign policy moves by the major powers  and coalitions in both the Global North and the Global South.  Thus a historical nodal point has arisen with the advent of the tragic war in Ukraine and the US hostilities towards China. The sanctions regimes of the US-led Global North have compounded the instabilities in the existing system. As the world system moves towards multipolarity, an opportunity exists for the Global South to construct through partial delinking from the post WW2 financial architecture under US hegemony. Construction of an expanded BRICS-led supra regional financial architecture along with regional financial architectures  will be a strategic step forward. Within two decades dedollarization will become a reality.

Consistent with this somewhat novel theory, in our complex, uneven world of international competition, technological innovation needs to be reconceptualized as a complex dynamic system with national systems facing imperatives of both competition and cooperation.

Consider also the real presence of aggressive imperialism fostered in the advanced countries through the finance capital, and structural compulsions of the WCS. The dangers of global confrontation and war mongering particularly by the ruling classes in the US with segments of EU and Japan following are real. The choice between the two paths acknowledged even by a prescient bourgeois economist like Schumpeter is clear. Schumpeter had presciently pointed towards the dire possibility of global conflagaration which now looks all too alarmingly real. Being somewhat of a pessimist, he was reluctant to see the prospects for a progressive peaceful socialism although he acknowledged the possibility of a non-capitalist future also. To be fair to him, the legacy of socialism in the 20th century has been ambiguous at best. The Chinese case since 1978 is particularly interesting from this standpoint. Clearly there are many ambiguities in the Chinese case also---not the least being the restoration of hierarchical management and stifling of grassroots democracy that existed during the Yenan period and at the post-1949 revolutionary moments.

But the employment opportunities in either sector are not growing adequately. The congestion, lack of infrastructure, inadequate provision and inequitable supply of health services are affecting the disadvantaged adversely. This paper attempts to analyze the emerging trends and patterns of urbanization and prospects for building the institutions and infrastructure for smart, inclusive and sustainable cities in Bangladesh within a dynamic framework with a strong emphasis on ruralurban migration and the informal sectors.

One of the book’s concluding reform proposals calls for increased emphasis on “tap water aesthetics” to make water “not merely safe, but truly excellent (220).” This recommendation sharply elucidates the authors’ political science approach to tap water. Currently, water utilities are required to meet safety standards, but not ones for taste, odor, or color (220). Following from the book’s social science argument, the policy critique is that a safety focus is too narrow because beliefs about water have broad consequences irrespective of what the technocratic approach says.

However, such routine gatherings also offer an opportunity to distribute self-tests to members of the community to potentially help mitigate transmission and reduce broader community spread of SARS-CoV-2. Over the past four years, self-testing strategies have been an impactful tool for countries’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially early on to mitigate the spread when vaccination and treatment options were limited. We used an agent-based mathematical model to estimate the impact of various strategies of symptomatic and asymptomatic self-testing for a fixed percentage of weekly routine gatherings at places of worship on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, Georgia, and Zambia. Testing strategies assessed included weekly and bi-weekly self-testing across varying levels of vaccine effectiveness, vaccine coverage, and reproductive numbers to simulate developing stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-testing symptomatic people attending routine gatherings can cost-effectively reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within places of worship and the community, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $69-$303 USD. This trend is especially true in contexts where population level attendance at such gatherings is high, demonstrating that a distribution approach is more impactful when a greater proportion of the population is reached.

Termites are a paradigmatic example of an organism’s having evolved the ability to substantially degrade lignified woody plants, yet atomic-scale characterization of lignin depolymerization by termites remains elusive. We report that the phylogenetically derived termite Nasutitermes sp. efficiently degrades lignin via substantial depletion of major interunit linkages and methoxyls by combining isotope-labeled feeding experiments and solution-state and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

256,JONATHAN J. WISCO,Downregulation of barley ferulate 5-hydroxylase dramatically alters straw lignin structure without impact on mechanical properties,"Barley is a major cereal crop for temperate climates, and a diploid genetic model for polyploid wheat. Cereal straw biomass is an attractive source of feedstock for green technologies but lignin, a key determinant of feedstock recalcitrance, complicates bio-conversion processes. However, manipulating lignin content to improve the conversion process could negatively affect agronomic traits. An alternative approach is to manipulate lignin composition which influences the physical and chemical properties of straw. This study validates the function of a barley ferulate 5-hydroxylase gene and demonstrates that its downregulation using the RNA-interference approach substantially impacts lignin composition. We identified five barley genes having putative ferulate 5-hydroxylase activity. Downregulation of HvF5H1 substantially reduced the lignin syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in straw while the lignin content, straw mechanical properties, plant growth habit, and grain characteristics all remained unaffected. Metabolic profiling revealed significant changes in the abundance of 173 features in the HvF5H1-RNAi lines. The drastic changes in the lignin polymer of transgenic lines highlight the plasticity of barley lignification processes and the associated potential for manipulating and improving lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for green technologies. On the other hand, our results highlight some differences between the lignin biosynthetic pathway in barley, a temperate climate grass, and the warm climate grass, rice, and underscore potential diversity in the lignin biosynthetic pathways in grasses.",2023,U24962746,"WISCO, JONATHAN J.",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

WISCO,Pinoresinol rescues developmental phenotypes of Arabidopsis phenylpropanoid mutants overexpressing FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE,"Most phenylpropanoid pathway flux is directed toward the production of monolignols, but this pathway also generates multiple bioactive metabolites. The monolignols coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol polymerize to form guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units in lignin, components that are characteristic of plant secondary cell walls. Lignin negatively impacts the saccharification potential of lignocellulosic biomass. Although manipulation of its content and composition through genetic engineering has reduced biomass recalcitrance, in some cases, these genetic manipulations lead to impaired growth. The reduced-growth phenotype is often attributed to poor water transport due to xylem collapse in low-lignin mutants, but alternative models suggest that it could be caused by the hyper- or hypoaccumulation of phenylpropanoid intermediates.

To gain insight into LMID in these genetic backgrounds, we determined whether growth impairment could be induced in other phenylpropanoid mutants by overexpression of F5H. To do so, we modulated the expression of F5H in two mutants deficient in C4H (ref3-2 and ref3-3), the enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of cinnamic acid to p-coumaric acid in the second step of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Plants carrying certain missense alleles in C4H have modest growth defects (13)(Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S2), although null alleles are seedling-lethal.

We leverage a U-Net architecture with cross-attention to preserve the positional information of the reference images, further guiding the target image generation. We train and evaluate QID on single-shell DWI samples curated from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. Specifically, we sub-sample the HCP gradient directions to produce low angular resolution DWI data and train QID to reconstruct the missing high angular resolution samples. We compare QID with two state-of-the-art GAN models. Our results demonstrate that QID not only achieves higher-quality generated images, but it consistently outperforms the GAN models in downstream tensor estimation across multiple metrics. Taken together, this study highlights the potential of diffusion models, and QID in particular, for q-space up-sampling, thus offering a promising toolkit for clinical and research applications.",2024,U24490722,"VENKATARAMAN, ARCHANA",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

In recent years, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating synthetic images with remarkable realism and diversity in many applications. This paper explores the potential of diffusion models for synthesizing DFU images and evaluates their authenticity through expert clinician assessments. Additionally, evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) are examined to assess the quality of the synthetic DFU images. A dataset of 2,000 DFU images is used for training the diffusion model, and the synthetic images are generated by applying diffusion processes. The results indicate that the diffusion model successfully synthesizes visually indistinguishable DFU images. 70% of the time, clinicians marked synthetic DFU images as real DFUs. However, clinicians demonstrate higher unanimous confidence in rating real images than synthetic ones. The study also reveals that FID and KID metrics do not significantly align with clinicians' assessments, suggesting alternative evaluation approaches are needed.

Though the efficacy and short-term safety of INM have been widely demonstrated in both peripheral and central nervous systems, the investigations of the detailed cellular and biological processes and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are still ongoing. In this review, we discuss the current research progress in the INM field with a focus on the more recently discovered IR nerve inhibition (INI).

282,RATNAKAR DEOLE,Culturomics approach to identify halophiles in edible salts,"Salts have been used in the food industry not only for flavoring of foods but also in food preservation. Refrigeration and vacuum sealing of food products have decreased the need for salt preservation. However, salt is still extensively utilized as a preservative. Salt’s ability as a preservative is because of its ability to reduce the growth of pathogens and other microorganisms that can result in spoilage of food products or illness. It does this by limiting the amount of unboundwater available to be used by microbes and their chemical reactions. However, salt can also be the source of living microorganisms called halophiles that may affect human health especially the gut microbiome. In this project, to determine the microbial communities of edible salts, an investigation was done using a culturomics approach. Four commercially used edible salts were purchased at the food store and dissolved in a solution and plated onto Difco marine agar and broth medium. Edible coarse sea salt showed growth of a halophile. This halophilic organism was purified using plating techniques and further identified using biochemical tests and 16S ribosomalRNA sequencing.",2022,U99880231,"DEOLE, RATNAKAR",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

287,DILLON BROUT,Modelling the impact of host galaxy dust on type Ia supernova distance measurements,"Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are a critical tool in measuring the accelerating expansion of the universe. Recent efforts to improve these standard candles have focused on incorporating the effects of dust on distance measurements with SNe Ia. In this paper, we use the state-of-the-art Dark Energy Survey 5 year sample to evaluate two different families of dust models: empirical extinction models derived from SNe Ia data, and physical attenuation models from the spectra of galaxies. Among the SNe Ia-derived models, we find that a logistic function of the total-to-selective extinction RV best recreates the correlations between supernova distance measurements and host galaxy properties, though an additional 0.02 magnitudes of grey scatter are needed to fully explain the scatter in SNIa brightness in all cases. These empirically-derived extinction distributions are highly incompatible with the physical attenuation models from galactic spectral measurements. From these results, we conclude that SNe Ia must either preferentially select extreme ends of galactic dust distributions, or that the characterisation of dust along the SNe Ia line-of-sight is incompatible with that of galactic dust distributions.",2024,U97863359,"BROUT, DILLON",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Hydrodynamic instabilities often manifest themselves in swirling flows as a helical vortex that winds around the vortex breakdown bubble. However, the heat released from combustion tends to suppress coherent vortex structures, which can limit the helical vortex to certain combustor geometries and operating conditions. Flame shape changes often accompany changes in hydrodynamic stability because they reposition the heat release and consequently modify the degree of coherent vortex suppression. In this study, laser diagnostics measurements were used to characterize the flow fields and spray patterns corresponding to different flame shapes that were observed in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) referee combustor. In particular, the flame fluctuated …",2023,U97501873,"ROCK, NICHOLAS",COLLEGE OF FINE ARTS (CFA)
289,DEBARGHYA MUKHERJEE,Transfer Learning Under High-Dimensional Graph Convolutional Regression Model for Node Classification,"Node classification is a fundamental task, but obtaining node classification labels can be challenging and expensive in many real-world scenarios. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by leveraging knowledge from source domains to enhance learning in a target domain. Existing transfer learning methods for node classification primarily focus on integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with various transfer learning techniques. While these approaches have shown promising results, they often suffer from a lack of theoretical guarantees, restrictive conditions, and high sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Graph Convolutional Multinomial Logistic Regression (GCR) model and a transfer learning method based on the GCR model, called Trans-GCR. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimate obtained under GCR model in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, Trans-GCR demonstrates superior empirical performance, has a low computational cost, and requires fewer hyperparameters than existing methods.",2024,U96946529,"MUKHERJEE, DEBARGHYA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
