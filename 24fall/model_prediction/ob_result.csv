0,DAVID GUZMAN,"Caribbean Corals in Crisis: Record Thermal Stress, Bleaching, and Mortality in 2005","BACKGROUND. The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.",U22412324,"GUZMAN, DAVID",COLLEGE OF FINE ARTS (CFA)
1,SAMUEL A ISAACSON,How reaction-diffusion PDEs approximate the large-population limit of stochastic particle models,"Reaction-diffusion PDEs and particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion (PBSRD) models are commonly-used approaches for modeling the spatial dynamics of chemical and biological systems. Standard reaction-diffusion PDE models ignore the underlying stochasticity of spatial transport and reactions, and are often described as appropriate in regimes where there are large numbers of particles in a system. Recent studies have proven the rigorous large-population limit of PBSRD models, showing the resulting mean-field models (MFM) correspond to non-local systems of partial-integro differential equations. In this work we explore the rigorous relationship between standard reaction-diffusion PDE models and the derived MFM. We prove that the former can be interpreted as an asymptotic approximation to the later in the limit that bimolecular reaction kernels are short-range and averaging. As the reactive interaction length scale approaches zero, we prove the MFMs converge at second order to standard reaction-diffusion PDE models. In proving this result we also establish local well-posedness of the MFM model in time for general systems, and global well-posedness for specific reaction systems and kernels. Finally, we illustrate the agreement and disagreement between the MFM, SM and the underlying particle model for several numerical examples.",U99514778,"ISAACSON, SAMUEL A",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

4,GEORGE T O'CONNOR,Characterization of Regulatory T Cells in Urban Newborns,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, asthma prevalence is particularly high among urban children. Although the underlying immune mechanism contributing to asthma has not been identified, having impaired T regulatory (Treg) cells at birth may be a determining factor in urban children. The objective of this study was to compare Treg phenotype and function in cord blood (CB) of newborns to those in peripheral blood (PB) of a subset of participating mothers. METHODS: Treg numbers, expression, and suppressive function were quantified in subjects recruited prenatally from neighborhoods where ≥ 20% of families have incomes below the poverty line. Proportion of Treg cells and expression of naïve (CD45RA) or activated (CD45RO, CD69, and HLA-DR) markers in CD4+T cells was measured by flow cytometry. Treg suppressive capacity was determined by quantifying PHA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation in mononuclear cell samples with and without CD25 depletion. RESULTS: In an urban cohort of 119 newborns and 82 mothers, we found that newborns had similar number of cells expressing FOXP3 as compared to the mothers but had reduced numbers of CD4+CD25+bright cells that predominantly expressed the naïve (CD45RA) rather than the activated/memory (CD45RO) phenotype found in the mothers. Additionally, the newborns had reduced mononuclear cell TGF-β production, and reduced Treg suppression of PHA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation compared to the mothers. CONCLUSION: U.S. urban newborns have Treg cells that express FOXP3, albeit with an immature phenotype and function as compared to the mothers. Longitudinal follow-up is needed to delineate Treg cell maturation and subsequent risk for atopic diseases in this urban birth cohort.",U98546341,"O'CONNOR, GEORGE T",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
5,CHRISTOPHER ROBERTSON,"SIVagm infection in wild African green monkeys from South Africa: epidemiology, natural history, and evolutionary considerations","Pathogenesis studies of SIV infection have not been performed to date in wild monkeys due to difficulty in collecting and storing samples on site and the lack of analytical reagents covering the extensive SIV diversity. We performed a large scale study of molecular epidemiology and natural history of SIVagm infection in 225 free-ranging AGMs from multiple locations in South Africa. SIV prevalence (established by sequencing pol, env, and gag) varied dramatically between infant/juvenile (7%) and adult animals (68%) (p,0.0001), and between adult females (78%) and males (57%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extensive genetic diversity, including frequent recombination events. Some AGMs harbored epidemiological linked viruses. Viruses infecting AGMs in the Free State, which are separated from those on the coastal side by the Drakensberg Mountains, formed a separate cluster in the phylogenetic trees; this observation supports a long standing presence of SIV in AGMs, at least from the time of their speciation to their Plio-Pleistocene migration. Specific primers/probes were synthesized based on the pol sequence data and viral loads (VLs) were quantified. VLs were of 104 –106 RNA copies/ml, in the range of those observed in experimentally-infected monkeys, validating the experimental approaches in natural hosts. VLs were significantly higher (107–108 RNA copies/ml) in 10 AGMs diagnosed as acutely infected based on SIV seronegativity (Fiebig II), which suggests a very active transmission of SIVagm in the wild. Neither cytokine levels (as biomarkers of immune activation) nor sCD14 levels (a biomarker of microbial translocation) were different between SIVinfected and SIV-uninfected monkeys. This complex algorithm combining sequencing and phylogeny, VL quantification, serology, and testing of surrogate markers of microbial translocation and immune activation permits a systematic investigation of the epidemiology, viral diversity and natural history of SIV infection in wild African natural hosts.",U97352761,"ROBERTSON, CHRISTOPHER",SCHOOL OF LAW (LAW)
6,CURTIS E WOODCOCK,Implications of land use change on the national terrestrial carbon budget of Georgia,"BACKGROUND: Globally, the loss of forests now contributes almost 20% of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. There is an immediate need to reduce the current rates of forest loss, and the associated release of carbon dioxide, but for many areas of the world these rates are largely unknown. The Soviet Union contained a substantial part of the world's forests and the fate of those forests and their effect on carbon dynamics remain unknown for many areas of the former Eastern Bloc. For Georgia, the political and economic transitions following independence in 1991 have been dramatic. In this paper we quantify rates of land use changes and their effect on the terrestrial carbon budget for Georgia. A carbon book-keeping model traces changes in carbon stocks using historical and current rates of land use change. Landsat satellite images acquired circa 1990 and 2000 were analyzed to detect changes in forest cover since 1990. RESULTS: The remote sensing analysis showed that a modest forest loss occurred, with approximately 0.8% of the forest cover having disappeared after 1990. Nevertheless, growth of Georgian forests still contribute a current national sink of about 0.3 Tg of carbon per year, which corresponds to 31% of the country anthropogenic carbon emissions. CONCLUSIONS: We assume that the observed forest loss is mainly a result of illegal logging, but we have not found any evidence of large-scale clear-cutting. Instead local harvesting of timber for household use is likely to be the underlying driver of the observed logging. The Georgian forests are a currently a carbon sink and will remain as such until about 2040 if the current rate of deforestation persists. Forest protection efforts, combined with economic growth, are essential for reducing the rate of deforestation and protecting the carbon sink provided by Georgian forests.",U02590572,"WOODCOCK, CURTIS E",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

8,CURTIS E WOODCOCK,Monitoring shifting cultivation in Laos with Landsat time series,"Shifting cultivation is an agricultural practice in which plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned, and vegetation is allowed to regenerate during fallow periods. Shifting cultivation is usually associated with cutting and burning forests and thus it is an important driver of forest disturbance in the tropics. However, studies of shifting cultivation are limited, and current area estimates of shifting cultivation are highly uncertain. Although Southeast Asia is a hotspot of shifting cultivation, there are no national maps of shifting cultivation in Southeast Asia at moderate or high resolution (less than or equal to 30 m). Monitoring shifting cultivation is challenging because it is highly dynamic, small-scale and results in complex post-disturbance landscapes. In this study, we monitored shifting cultivation using Landsat time series on Google Earth Engine for the entire country of Laos from 1991 to 2020. First, CCDC-SMA (Continuous Change Detection and Classification - Spectral Mixture Analysis) was used to detect forest disturbances. Then, these disturbances were attributed by combining time series analysis, object-based image analysis (OBIA), and post-disturbance land cover classification. Forest disturbances were assigned to Shifting cultivation, New plantation, Deforestation, Severe Drought, and Subtle Disturbance annually from 1991 to 2020 at a 30-m resolution. The major forest disturbances in 1991–2020 were mapped with an overall accuracy of 85%. Shifting cultivation is mapped with a producer’s accuracy of 88% and a user’s accuracy of 80%. The margin of error of the sampling-based area estimates of Shifting cultivation is 5.9%. Shifting cultivation is the main land use in Laos, accounting for 32.9% ± 1.9% of Laos over the past 30 years. To study changes in shifting cultivation over time, the area of shifting cultivation was estimated at 5-year intervals between 1991 and 2020 with all margins of error <17%. Results show that the area of slash-and-burn activities in Laos increased in 2015–2020. Our study provides an effective approach for monitoring shifting cultivation, which can be potentially applied into other regions. Our results not only provide valuable information for land management in Laos, but also can support analysis of spatial-temporal patterns of shifting cultivation and estimation of carbon emissions associated with shifting cultivation for REDD+ reporting.",U02590572,"WOODCOCK, CURTIS E",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
9,CURTIS E WOODCOCK,Satellite data reveals a recent increase in shifting cultivation and associated carbon emissions in Laos,"Although shifting cultivation is the major land use type in Laos, the spatial-temporal patterns and the associated carbon emissions of shifting cultivation in Laos are largely unknown. This study provides a nationwide analysis of the spatial-temporal patterns of shifting cultivation and estimations of the associated carbon emissions in Laos over the last three decades. This study found that shifting cultivation has been expanding and intensifying in Laos, especially in the last 5 years. The newly cultivated land from 2016 to 2020 accounted for 4.5% (±1.2%) of the total land area of Laos. Furthermore, the length of fallow periods has been continuously declining, indicating that shifting cultivation is becoming increasingly intensive. Combining biomass derived from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and shifting cultivation maps and area estimates, we found that the net carbon emissions from shifting cultivation declined in 2001–2015 but increased in 2016–2020. The largest carbon source is conversion from intact forests to shifting cultivation, which contributed to 89% of the total emissions from 2001 to 2020. In addition, there were increased emissions from intensified use of fallow lands. This research provides useful information for policymakers in Laos to understand the changes in shifting cultivation and improve land use management. This study not only supports Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation reporting for Laos but also provides a methodology for tracking carbon emissions and removals of shifting cultivation.",U02590572,"WOODCOCK, CURTIS E",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
10,THOMAS GILMORE,Intraspecific variation in oxidative stress tolerance in a model cnidarian: differences in peroxide sensitivity between and within populations of Nematostella vectensis,"Nematostella vectensis is a member of the phylum Cnidaria, a lineage that includes anemones, corals, hydras, and jellyfishes. This estuarine anemone is an excellent model system for investigating the evolution of stress tolerance because it is easy to collect in its natural habitat and to culture in the laboratory, and it has a sequenced genome. Additionally, there is evidence of local adaptation to environmental stress in different N. vectensis populations, and abundant protein-coding polymorphisms have been identified, including polymorphisms in proteins that are implicated in stress responses. N. vectensis can tolerate a wide range of environmental parameters, and has recently been shown to have substantial intraspecific variation in temperature preference. We investigated whether different clonal lines of anemones also exhibit differential tolerance to oxidative stress. N. vectensis populations are continually exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during cellular metabolism and by other environmental factors. Fifteen clonal lines of N. vectensis collected from four different estuaries were exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Pronounced differences in survival and regeneration were apparent between clonal lines collected from Meadowlands, NJ, Baruch, SC, and Kingsport, NS, as well as among 12 clonal lines collected from a single Cape Cod marsh. To our knowledge, this is the first example of intraspecific variability in oxidative stress resistance in cnidarians or in any marine animal. As oxidative stress often accompanies heat stress in marine organisms, resistance to oxidative stress could strongly influence survival in warming oceans. For example, while elevated temperatures trigger bleaching in corals, oxidative stress is thought to be the proximal trigger of bleaching at the cellular level.",U03071487,"GILMORE, THOMAS",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
11,THOMAS GILMORE,Varied effects of algal symbionts on transcription factor NF-κB in a sea anemone and a coral: possible roles in symbiosis and thermotolerance,"Many cnidarians, including the reef-building corals, undergo symbiotic mutualisms with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These partnerships are sensitive to temperature extremes, which cause symbiont loss and increased coral mortality. Previous studies have implicated host immunity and specifically immunity transcription factor NF-κB as having a role in the maintenance of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Here we have further investigated a possible role for NF-κB in establishment and loss of symbiosis in various strains of the anemone Exaiptasia (Aiptasia) and in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results show that NF-κB expression is reduced in Aiptasia larvae and adults that host certain algae strains. Treatment of Aiptasia larvae with a known symbiosis-promoting cytokine, transforming growth factor β, also led to decreased NF-κB expression. We also show that aposymbiotic Aiptasia (with high NF-κB expression) have increased survival following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens as compared to symbiotic Aiptasia (low NF-κB expression). Furthermore, a P. damicornis coral colony hosting Durusdinium spp. (formerly clade D) symbionts had higher basal NF-κB expression and decreased heat-induced bleaching as compared to two individuals hosting Cladocopium spp. (formerly clade C) symbionts. Lastly, genome-wide gene expression profiling and genomic promoter analysis identified putative NF-κB target genes that may be involved in thermal bleaching, symbiont maintenance, and/or immune protection in P. damicornis. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis that modulation of NF-κB and immunity plays a role in some, but perhaps not all, cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships as well as in resistance to pathogens and bleaching.",U03071487,"GILMORE, THOMAS",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
12,THOMAS F WEBSTER,Using Residential History and Groundwater Modeling to Examine Drinking Water Exposure and Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND. Spatial analyses of case-control data have suggested a possible link between breast cancer and groundwater plumes in upper Cape Cod, Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE. We integrated residential histories, public water distribution systems, and groundwater modeling within geographic information systems (GIS) to examine the association between exposure to drinking water that has been contaminated by wastewater effluent and breast cancer. METHODS. Exposure was assessed from 1947 to 1993 for 638 breast cancer cases who were diagnosed from 1983 to 1993 and 842 controls; we took into account residential mobility and drinking water source. To estimate the historical impact of effluent on drinking water wells, we modified a modular three-dimensional finite-difference groundwater model (MODFLOW) from the U.S. Geological Survey. The analyses included latency and exposure duration. RESULTS. Wastewater effluent impacted the drinking water wells of study participants as early as 1966. For > 0-5 years of exposure (versus no exposure), associations were generally null. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for > 10 years of exposure were slightly increased, assuming latency periods of 0 or 10 years [AOR = 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-1.9 and AOR = 1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-3.2, respectively]. Statistically significant associations were estimated for ever-exposed versus never-exposed women when a 20-year latency period was assumed (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.4). A sensitivity analysis that classified exposures assuming lower well-pumping rates showed similar results. CONCLUSION. We investigated the hypothesis generated by earlier spatial analyses that exposure to drinking water contaminated by wastewater effluent may be associated with breast cancer. Using a detailed exposure assessment, we found an association with breast cancer that increased with longer latency and greater exposure duration.",U85153053,"WEBSTER, THOMAS F",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
13,THOMAS F WEBSTER,Evaluation of the Webler-Brown Model for Estimating Tetrachloroethylene Exposure from Vinyl-Lined Asbestos-Cement Pipes,"BACKGROUND: From May 1968 through March 1980, vinyl-lined asbestos-cement (VL/AC) water distribution pipes were installed in New England to avoid taste and odor problems associated with asbestos-cement pipes. The vinyl resin was applied to the inner pipe surface in a solution of tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE). Substantial amounts of PCE remained in the liner and subsequently leached into public drinking water supplies. METHODS: Once aware of the leaching problem and prior to remediation (April-November 1980), Massachusetts regulators collected drinking water samples from VL/AC pipes to determine the extent and severity of the PCE contamination. This study compares newly obtained historical records of PCE concentrations in water samples (n = 88) with concentrations estimated using an exposure model employed in epidemiologic studies on the cancer risk associated with PCE-contaminated drinking water. The exposure model was developed by Webler and Brown to estimate the mass of PCE delivered to subjects' residences. RESULTS: The mean and median measured PCE concentrations in the water samples were 66 and 0.5 μg/L, respectively, and the range extended from non-detectable to 2432 μg/L. The model-generated concentration estimates and water sample concentrations were moderately correlated (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.48, p < 0.0001). Correlations were higher in samples taken at taps and spigots vs. hydrants (ρ = 0.84 vs. 0.34), in areas with simple vs. complex geometry (ρ = 0.51 vs. 0.38), and near pipes installed in 1973–1976 vs. other years (ρ = 0.56 vs. 0.42 for 1968–1972 and 0.37 for 1977–1980). Overall, 24% of the variance in measured PCE concentrations was explained by the model-generated concentration estimates (p < 0.0001). Almost half of the water samples had undetectable concentrations of PCE. Undetectable levels were more common in areas with the earliest installed VL/AC pipes, at the beginning and middle of VL/AC pipes, at hydrants, and in complex pipe configurations. CONCLUSION: PCE concentration estimates generated using the Webler-Brown model were moderately correlated with measured water concentrations. The present analysis suggests that the exposure assessment process used in prior epidemiological studies could be improved with more accurate characterization of water flow. This study illustrates one method of validating an exposure model in an epidemiological study when historical measurements are not available.",U85153053,"WEBSTER, THOMAS F",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
14,YANHANG ZHANG,Compressive remodeling alters fluid transport properties of collagen networks - implications for tumor growth,"Biomechanical alterations to the tumor microenvironment include accumulation of solid stresses, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening and increased fluid pressure in both interstitial and peri-tumoral spaces. The relationship between interstitial fluid pressurization and ECM remodeling in vascularized tumors is well characterized, while earlier biomechanical changes occurring during avascular tumor growth within the peri-tumoral ECM remain poorly understood. Type I collagen, the primary fibrous ECM constituent, bears load in tension while it buckles under compression. We hypothesized that tumor-generated compressive forces cause collagen remodeling via densification which in turn creates a barrier to convective fluid transport and may play a role in tumor progression and malignancy. To better understand this process, we characterized the structure-function relationship of collagen networks under compression both experimentally and computationally. Here we show that growth of epithelial cancers induces compressive remodeling of the ECM, documented in the literature as a TACS-2 phenotype, which represents a localized densification and tangential alignment of peri-tumoral collagen. Such compressive remodeling is caused by the unique features of collagen network mechanics, such as fiber buckling and cross-link rupture, and reduces the overall hydraulic permeability of the matrix.",U83955956,"ZHANG, YANHANG",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

16,PIERRE PERRON,Disentangling the trend in the warming of urban areas into global and local factors,"Large cities account for a significant share of national population and wealth, and exert high pressure on local and regional resources, exacerbating socioenvironmental risks. The replacement of natural landscapes with higher heat capacity materials because of urbanization and anthropogenic waste heat are some of the factors contributing to local climate change caused by the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Because of synergistic effects, local climate change can exacerbate the impacts of global warming in cities. Disentangling the contributions to warming in cities from global and local drivers can help to understand their relative importance and guide local adaptation policies. The canopy UHI intensity is commonly approximated by the difference between temperatures within cities and the surrounding areas. We present a complementary approach that applies the concept of common trends to extract the global contributions to observed warming in cities and to obtain a residual warming trend caused by local and regional factors. Once the effects of global drivers are removed, common features appear in cities' temperatures in the eastern part of the United States. Most cities experienced higher warming than that attributable to global climate change, and some shared a period of rapid warming during urban sprawl in the mid-20th century in the United States.",U81195691,"PERRON, PIERRE",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
17,JOHN MARSTON,Modeling resilience and sustainability in ancient agricultural systems,"The reasons why people adopt unsustainable agricultural practices, and the ultimate environmental implications of those practices, remain incompletely understood in the present world. Archaeology, however, offers unique datasets on coincident cultural and ecological change, and their social and environmental effects. This article applies concepts derived from ecological resilience thinking to assess the sustainability of agricultural practices as a result of long-term interactions between political, economic, and environmental systems. Using the urban center of Gordion, in central Turkey, as a case study, it is possible to identify mismatched social and ecological processes on temporal, spatial, and organizational scales, which help to resolve thresholds of resilience. Results of this analysis implicate temporal and spatial mismatches as a cause for local environmental degradation, and increasing extralocal economic pressures as an ultimate cause for the adoption of unsustainable land-use practices. This analysis suggests that a research approach that integrates environmental archaeology with a resilience perspective has considerable potential for explicating regional patterns of agricultural change and environmental degradation in the past.",U05765250,"MARSTON, JOHN",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
18,JORGE DELVA,Pervasive exposure to violence and posttraumatic stress disorder in a predominantly African American urban community: the Detroit neighborhood health study,"Exposure to traumatic events is common, particularly among economically disadvantaged, urban African Americans. There is, however, scant data on the psychological consequences of exposure to traumatic events in this group. We assessed experience with traumatic events and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 1,306 randomly selected, African American residents of Detroit. Lifetime prevalence of exposure to at least 1 traumatic event was 87.2% (assault = 51.0%). African Americans from Detroit have a relatively high burden of PTSD; 17.1% of those who experienced a traumatic event met criteria for probable lifetime PTSD. Assaultive violence is pervasive and is more likely to be associated with subsequent PTSD than other types of events. Further efforts to prevent violence and increase access to mental health treatment could reduce the mental health burden in economically disadvantaged urban areas.",U77028745,"DELVA, JORGE",SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK (SSW)
19,DEBORAH CARR,Global population aging and heat exposure in the 21st century: implications for late-life well-being and policy,"Climate change has profound consequences for older adults’ well-being. Global increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme heat spells pose the most direct threats, given older adults’ underlying health conditions and reduced capacity to thermoregulate. Individual-level consequences of heat exposure are well-documented, yet gerontological research has paid less attention to older adults’ heat exposure at the population level. World regions with both increasing concentrations of older adults and high temperature extremes are potential hotspots where growing aged populations are at risk of heat-related health threats. We estimate older adults’ current and future heat exposure in six global regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America). Analyses use NASA NEX Global Daily Downscaled Product climate data and country-level projections for the size and distribution of the age 65+ population. We focus on measures of cumulative heat exposure (cooling degree days) and acute exposure to heat extremes (95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures). We project that by 2050, populations aged 65+ globally exposed to &amp;gt;1200 cooling degree days will double. We also project that one-quarter of the aged population worldwide (roughly 340 million) will be living in climates with 95th percentile TMax95 &amp;gt; 99.5 F◦, a critical exposure threshold for health. The drivers of this population-level exposure vary by region. Population aging will drive exposure in historically hot regions in Africa and Asia, whereas climate change will drive heat exposure in historically older regions in Europe and North America. These results can inform public policy and local decision-making.",U76996265,"CARR, DEBORAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Comovements in these are examined at the household and village levels, combining satellite imagery and household (Nepal Living Standard Measurement Survey) data. Projections of the impact of economic growth based on Engel curves turn out to be highly inaccurate: forest conditions remained stable despite considerable growth in household consumption and income. Firewood collections at the village level remained stable, as effects of demographic growth were offset by substantial reductions in per household collections. Households substituted firewood by alternative energy sources, particularly when livestock and farm-based occupations declined in importance.

We analyse a tenancy registration programme in West Bengal, and find that it increased child survival and reduced fertility. However, we also find that it intensified son preference in families without a first-born son to inherit the land title. These families exhibit no reduction in fertility, an increase in the probability that a subsequent birth is male, and a substantial increase in the survival advantage of subsequent sons over daughters.",U74548967,"MOOKHERJEE, DILIP",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

23,PAMELA H TEMPLER,"Tree transpiration and urban temperatures: current understanding, implications, and future research directions","The expansion of an urban tree canopy is a commonly proposed nature-based solution to combat excess urban heat. The influence trees have on urban climates via shading is driven by the morphological characteristics of trees, whereas tree transpiration is predominantly a physiological process dependent on environmental conditions and the built environment. The heterogeneous nature of urban landscapes, unique tree species assemblages, and land management decisions make it difficult to predict the magnitude and direction of cooling by transpiration. In the present article, we synthesize the emerging literature on the mechanistic controls on urban tree transpiration. We present a case study that illustrates the relationship between transpiration (using sap flow data) and urban temperatures. We examine the potential feed backs among urban canopy, the built environment, and climate with a focus on extreme heat events. Finally, we present modeled data demonstrating the influence of transpiration on temperatures with shifts in canopy extent and irrigation during a heat wave.",U73274179,"TEMPLER, PAMELA H",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

25,TIMOTHY HEEREN,Evaluation of the Webler-Brown Model for Estimating Tetrachloroethylene Exposure from Vinyl-Lined Asbestos-Cement Pipes,"BACKGROUND: From May 1968 through March 1980, vinyl-lined asbestos-cement (VL/AC) water distribution pipes were installed in New England to avoid taste and odor problems associated with asbestos-cement pipes. The vinyl resin was applied to the inner pipe surface in a solution of tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE). Substantial amounts of PCE remained in the liner and subsequently leached into public drinking water supplies. METHODS: Once aware of the leaching problem and prior to remediation (April-November 1980), Massachusetts regulators collected drinking water samples from VL/AC pipes to determine the extent and severity of the PCE contamination. This study compares newly obtained historical records of PCE concentrations in water samples (n = 88) with concentrations estimated using an exposure model employed in epidemiologic studies on the cancer risk associated with PCE-contaminated drinking water. The exposure model was developed by Webler and Brown to estimate the mass of PCE delivered to subjects' residences. RESULTS: The mean and median measured PCE concentrations in the water samples were 66 and 0.5 μg/L, respectively, and the range extended from non-detectable to 2432 μg/L. The model-generated concentration estimates and water sample concentrations were moderately correlated (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.48, p < 0.0001). Correlations were higher in samples taken at taps and spigots vs. hydrants (ρ = 0.84 vs. 0.34), in areas with simple vs. complex geometry (ρ = 0.51 vs. 0.38), and near pipes installed in 1973–1976 vs. other years (ρ = 0.56 vs. 0.42 for 1968–1972 and 0.37 for 1977–1980). Overall, 24% of the variance in measured PCE concentrations was explained by the model-generated concentration estimates (p < 0.0001). Almost half of the water samples had undetectable concentrations of PCE. Undetectable levels were more common in areas with the earliest installed VL/AC pipes, at the beginning and middle of VL/AC pipes, at hydrants, and in complex pipe configurations. CONCLUSION: PCE concentration estimates generated using the Webler-Brown model were moderately correlated with measured water concentrations. The present analysis suggests that the exposure assessment process used in prior epidemiological studies could be improved with more accurate characterization of water flow. This study illustrates one method of validating an exposure model in an epidemiological study when historical measurements are not available.",U71534406,"HEEREN, TIMOTHY",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
26,MARK KRAMER,"Caribbean Corals in Crisis: Record Thermal Stress, Bleaching, and Mortality in 2005","BACKGROUND. The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.",U68933867,"KRAMER, MARK",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
27,JAMES ANDERSON,An Assessment of Potential Exposure and Risk from Estrogens in Drinking Water,"BACKGROUND. Detection of estrogens in the environment has raised concerns in recent years because of their potential to affect both wildlife and humans. OBJECTIVES. We compared exposures to prescribed and naturally occurring estrogens in drinking water to exposures to naturally occurring background levels of estrogens in the diet of children and adults and to four independently derived acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) to determine whether drinking water intakes are larger or smaller than dietary intake or ADIs. METHODS. We used the Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation (PhATE) model to predict concentrations of estrogens potentially present in drinking water. Predicted drinking water concentrations were combined with default water intake rates to estimate drinking water exposures. Predicted drinking water intakes were compared to dietary intakes and also to ADIs. We present comparisons for individual estrogens as well as combined estrogens. RESULTS. In the analysis we estimated that a child's exposures to individual prescribed estrogens in drinking water are 730-480,000 times lower (depending upon estrogen type) than exposure to background levels of naturally occurring estrogens in milk. A child's exposure to total estrogens in drinking water (prescribed and naturally occurring) is about 150 times lower than exposure from milk. Adult margins of exposure (MOEs) based on total dietary exposure are about 2 times smaller than those for children. Margins of safety (MOSs) for an adult's exposure to total prescribed estrogens in drinking water vary from about 135 to > 17,000, depending on ADI. MOSs for exposure to total estrogens in drinking water are about 2 times lower than MOSs for prescribed estrogens. Depending on the ADI that is used, MOSs for young children range from 28 to 5,120 for total estrogens (including both prescribed and naturally occurring sources) in drinking water. CONCLUSIONS. The consistently large MOEs and MOSs strongly suggest that prescribed and total estrogens that may potentially be present in drinking water in the United States are not causing adverse effects in U.S. residents, including sensitive subpopulations.",U67450639,"ANDERSON, JAMES",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

They extend Ingold’s call for “ecologies of life” by clarifying how latent potentials become manifest and how new symbiotic assemblages can be created in disturbed ecosystems. These cases arise from the rapid urban expansion in wealthy parts of China, accompanied by the resettlement of many villagers into high-rise buildings, wiping out farms, village temples, and rural graves and making earlier forms of social organization impossible. The territorially based religion described in much of the anthropological and historical literature has thus become increasingly untenable.

29,MICHAEL MENDILLO,Long‐term observations and physical processes in the Moon's extended sodium tail,"The lunar surface is constantly bombarded by the solar wind, photons, and meteoroids, which can liberate Na atoms from the regolith. These atoms are subsequently accelerated by solar photon pressure to form a long comet-like tail opposite the sun. Near new moon, these atoms encounter the Earth's gravity and are “focused” into a beam of enhanced density. This beam appears as the ∼3° diameter Sodium Moon Spot (SMS). Data from the all sky imager at the El Leoncito Observatory have been analyzed for changes in the SMS shape and brightness. New geometry-based relationships have been found that affect the SMS brightness. The SMS is brighter when the Moon is north of the ecliptic at new moon; the SMS is brighter when new moon occurs near perigee; and the SMS peaks in brightness ∼5 h after new moon. After removing these effects, the data were analyzed for long term and seasonal patterns that could be attributed to changes in source mechanisms. No correlation was found between the SMS brightness and the 11-year solar-cycle, the proton or the He++ flow pressure, the density, the speed or the plasma temperature of the solar wind, but an annual pattern was found. A ∼0.83 correlation (Pearson's “r”) was found between the SMS brightness and a 4-year average of sporadic meteor rates at Earth, suggesting a cause-and-effect. The new insights gained from this long-term study put new constraints on the variability of the potential sources of the Na atoms escaping from the Moon.",U10063811,"MENDILLO, MICHAEL",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

31,ROBINSON W FULWEILER,Molecular evidence for sediment nitrogen fixation in a temperate New England estuary,"Primary production in coastal waters is generally nitrogen (N) limited with denitrification outpacing nitrogen fixation (N2-fixation). However, recent work suggests that we have potentially underestimated the importance of heterotrophic sediment N2-fixation in marine ecosystems. We used clone libraries to examine transcript diversity of nifH (a gene associated with N2-fixation) in sediments at three sites in a temperate New England estuary (Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA) and compared our results to net sediment N2 fluxes previously measured at these sites. We observed nifH expression at all sites, including a site heavily impacted by anthropogenic N. At this N impacted site, we also observed mean net sediment N2-fixation, linking the geochemical rate measurement with nifH expression. This same site also had the lowest diversity (non-parametric Shannon = 2.75). At the two other sites, we also detected nifH transcripts, however, the mean N2 flux indicated net denitrification. These results suggest that N2-fixation and denitrification co-occur in these sediments. Of the unique sequences in this study, 67% were most closely related to uncultured bacteria from various marine environments, 17% to Cluster III, 15% to Cluster I, and only 1% to Cluster II. These data add to the growing body of literature that sediment heterotrophic N2-fixation, even under high inorganic nitrogen concentrations, may be an important yet overlooked source of N in coastal systems.",U59820817,"FULWEILER, ROBINSON W",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
32,ROBINSON W FULWEILER,Soil warming accelerates biogeochemical silica cycling in a temperate forest,"Biological cycling of silica plays an important role in terrestrial primary production. Soil warming stemming from climate change can alter the cycling of elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, in forested ecosystems. However, the effects of soil warming on the biogeochemical cycle of silica in forested ecosystems remain unexplored. Here we examine long-term forest silica cycling under ambient and warmed conditions over a 15-year period of experimental soil warming at Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA). Specifically, we measured silica concentrations in organic and mineral soils, and in the foliage and litter of two dominant species (Acer rubrum and Quercus rubra), in a large (30 × 30 m) heated plot and an adjacent control plot (30 × 30 m). In 2016, we also examined effects of heating on dissolved silica in the soil solution, and conducted a litter decomposition experiment using four tree species (Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra, Betula lenta, Tsuga canadensis) to examine effects of warming on the release of biogenic silica (BSi) from plants to soils. We find that tree foliage maintained constant silica concentrations in the control and warmed plots, which, coupled with productivity enhancements under warming, led to an increase in total plant silica uptake. We also find that warming drove an acceleration in the release of silica from decaying litter in three of the four species we examined, and a substantial increase in the silica dissolved in soil solution. However, we observe no changes in soil BSi stocks with warming. Together, our data indicate that warming increases the magnitude of silica uptake by vegetation and accelerates the internal cycling of silica in in temperate forests, with possible, and yet unresolved, effects on the delivery of silica from terrestrial to marine systems.",U59820817,"FULWEILER, ROBINSON W",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
33,RANGA B MYNENI,Analysis of global LAI/FPAR Pproducts from VIIRS and MODIS sensors for spatio-temporal consistency and uncertainty from 2012-2016,"The operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) algorithm has been successfully implemented for Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations by optimizing a small set of configurable parameters in Look-Up-Tables (LUTs). Our preliminary evaluation showed reasonable agreement between VIIRS and MODIS LAI/FPAR retrievals. However, there is a need for a more comprehensive investigation to assure continuity of multi-sensor global LAI/FPAR time series, as the preliminary evaluation was spatiotemporally limited. In this study, we use a multi-year (2012–2016) global LAI/FPAR product generated from VIIRS and MODIS to evaluate for spatiotemporal consistency. We also quantify uncertainty of the product by utilizing available ground measurements. For both consistency and uncertainty evaluation, we account for variations in biome type and temporal resolution. Our results indicate that the LAI/FPAR retrievals from VIIRS and MODIS are consistent at different spatial (i.e., global and site) and temporal (i.e., 8-day, seasonal and annual) scales. The estimate of mean discrepancy (−0.006 ± 0.013 for LAI and −0.002 ± 0.002 for FPAR) meets the stability requirement for long-term LAI/FPAR Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) from multi-sensors as suggested by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). It is noteworthy that the rate of retrievals from the radiative transfer-based main algorithm is also comparable between two sensors. However, a relatively larger discrepancy over tropical forests was observed due to reflectance saturation and an unexpected interannual variation of main algorithm success was noticed due to instability in input surface reflectances. The uncertainties/relative uncertainties of VIIRS and MODIS LAI (FPAR) products assessed through comparisons to ground measurements are estimated to be 0.60/42.2% (0.10/24.4%) and 0.55/39.3% (0.11/26%), respectively. Note that the validated LAI were only distributed in low domains (~2.5), resulting in large relative uncertainty. Therefore, more ground measurements are needed to achieve a more comprehensive evaluation result of product uncertainty. The results presented here generally imbue confidence in the consistency between VIIRS and MODIS LAI/FPAR products and the feasibility of generating long-term multi-sensor LAI/FPAR ESDRs time series.",U59707480,"MYNENI, RANGA B",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
34,RANGA B MYNENI,Abiotic controls on macroscale variations of humid tropical forest height,"Spatial variation of tropical forest tree height is a key indicator of ecological processes associated with forest growth and carbon dynamics. Here we examine the macroscale variations of tree height of humid tropical forests across three continents and quantify the climate and edaphic controls on these variations. Forest tree heights are systematically sampled across global humid tropical forests with more than 2.5 million measurements from Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) satellite observations (2004–2008). We used top canopy height (TCH) of GLAS footprints to grid the statistical mean and variance and the 90 percentile height of samples at 0.5 degrees to capture the regional variability of average and large trees globally. We used the spatial regression method (spatial eigenvector mapping-SEVM) to evaluate the contributions of climate, soil and topography in explaining and predicting the regional variations of forest height. Statistical models suggest that climate, soil, topography, and spatial contextual information together can explain more than 60% of the observed forest height variation, while climate and soil jointly explain 30% of the height variations. Soil basics, including physical compositions such as clay and sand contents, chemical properties such as PH values and cation-exchange capacity, as well as biological variables such as the depth of organic matter, all present independent but statistically significant relationships to forest height across three continents. We found significant relations between the precipitation and tree height with shorter trees on the average in areas of higher annual water stress, and large trees occurring in areas with low stress and higher annual precipitation but with significant differences across the continents. Our results confirm other landscape and regional studies by showing that soil fertility, topography and climate may jointly control a significant variation of forest height and influencing patterns of aboveground biomass stocks and dynamics. Other factors such as biotic and disturbance regimes, not included in this study, may have less influence on regional variations but strongly mediate landscape and small-scale forest structure and dynamics.",U59707480,"MYNENI, RANGA B",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
35,RANGA B MYNENI,Vegetation angular signatures of equatorial forests from DSCOVR EPIC and Terra MISR observations,"In vegetation canopies cross-shading between finite dimensional leaves leads to a peak in reflectance in the retro-illumination direction. This effect is called the hot spot in optical remote sensing. The hotspot region in reflectance of vegetated surfaces represents the most information-rich directions in the angular distribution of canopy reflected radiation. This paper presents a new approach for generating hot spot signatures of equatorial forests from synergistic analyses of multiangle observations from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on Terra platform and near backscattering reflectance data from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard NOAA’s Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). A canopy radiation model parameterized in terms of canopy spectral invariants underlies the theoretical basis for joining Terra MISR and DSCOVR EPIC data. The proposed model can accurately reproduce both MISR angular signatures acquired at 10:30 local solar time and diurnal courses of EPIC reflectance (NRMSE < 9%, R^2 > 0.8).

We developed a BRF model, which could approximate DSCOVR/EPIC and MISR observations, through analyses of variations in magnitude and shape of angular distribution of canopy reflected radiation and the rigorous use of radiative transfer theory. In this model, the correlation coefficient, visible fraction of leaf area in the direction Ω from the sunlit areas of leaves, is an important parameter that allows us to extend conventional radiative transfer equation to media with finite dimensional scatters and consequently accurately discriminate between sunlit and shaded leaves.

We develop a new emissions inventory, the Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE), which estimates CO2 emitted by US road transport at a resolution of 1 km annually for 1980-2012. DARTE reveals that urban areas are responsible for 80% of on-road emissions growth since 1980 and for 63% of total 2012 emissions. We observe nonlinearities between CO2 emissions and population density at broad spatial/temporal scales, with total on-road CO2 increasing nonlinearly with population density, rapidly up to 1,650 persons per square kilometer and slowly thereafter. Per capita emissions decline as density rises, but at markedly varying rates depending on existing densities. We make use of DARTE's bottom-up construction to highlight the biases associated with the common practice of using population as a linear proxy for disaggregating national- or state-scale emissions. Comparing DARTE with existing downscaled inventories, we find biases of 100% or more in the spatial distribution of urban and rural emissions, largely driven by mismatches between inventory downscaling proxies and the actual spatial patterns of vehicle activity at urban scales. Given cities' dual importance as sources of CO2 and an emerging nexus of climate mitigation initiatives, high-resolution estimates such as DARTE are critical both for accurately quantifying surface carbon fluxes and for verifying the effectiveness of emissions mitigation efforts at urban scales.",U12101555,"HUTYRA, LUCY",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

We describe jump-starting a tree-ring collection across the continent of North America, given the commitments of Canada, the United States, and Mexico to visit forest inventory plots, along with existing legacy collections.

In this study, we introduce a new terrestrial carbon cycle data assimilation system, built on the PEcAn modeldata eco-informatics system, and its application for the development of a proof-of-concept carbon ""reanalysis"" product that harmonizes carbon 5 pools (leaf, wood, soil) and fluxes (GPP, Ra, Rh, NEE) across the contiguous United States from 1986- 2019. We first calibrated this system against plant trait and flux tower Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) using a novel emulated hierarchical Bayesian approach. Next, we extended the Tobit-Wishart Ensemble Filter (TWEnF) State Data Assimilation (SDA) framework, a generalization of the common Ensemble Kalman Filter which accounts for censored data and provides a fully Bayesian estimate of model process error, to a regional-scale system with a calibrated localization. Combined with additional 10 workflows for propagating parameter, initial condition, and driver uncertainty, this represents the most complete and robust uncertainty accounting available for terrestrial carbon models. Our initial reanalysis was run on an irregular grid of   500 points selected using a stratified sampling method to efficiently capture environmental heterogeneity. Remotely sensed observations of aboveground biomass (Landsat LandTrendr) and LAI (MODIS MOD15) were sequentially assimilated into the SIPNET model. Reanalysis soil carbon, which was indirectly constrained based on modeled covariances, showed general agreement 15 with SoilGrids, an independent soil carbon data product. Reanalysis NEE, which was constrained based on posterior ensemble weights, also showed good agreement with eddy flux tower NEE and reduced RMSE compared to the calibrated forecast. Ultimately, PEcAn’s carbon cycle reanalysis provides a scalable framework for harmonizing multiple data constraints and providing a uniform synthetic platform for carbon monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) and accelerating terrestrial carbon cycle research.",U51184461,"DIETZE, MICHAEL",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
42,MICHAEL DIETZE,Evaluation of 11 terrestrial carbon–nitrogen cycle models against observations from two temperate Free‐Air CO2 Enrichment studies,"We analysed the responses of 11 ecosystem models to elevated atmospheric [CO2] (eCO2) at two temperate forest ecosystems (Duke and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Free‐Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments) to test alternative representations of carbon (C)–nitrogen (N) cycle processes. We decomposed the model responses into component processes affecting the response to eCO2 and confronted these with observations from the FACE experiments. Most of the models reproduced the observed initial enhancement of net primary production (NPP) at both sites, but none was able to simulate both the sustained 10‐yr enhancement at Duke and the declining response at ORNL: models generally showed signs of progressive N limitation as a result of lower than observed plant N uptake. Nonetheless, many models showed qualitative agreement with observed component processes. The results suggest that improved representation of above‐ground–below‐ground interactions and better constraints on plant stoichiometry are important for a predictive understanding of eCO2 effects. Improved accuracy of soil organic matter inventories is pivotal to reduce uncertainty in the observed C–N budgets. The two FACE experiments are insufficient to fully constrain terrestrial responses to eCO2, given the complexity of factors leading to the observed diverging trends, and the consequential inability of the models to explain these trends. Nevertheless, the ecosystem models were able to capture important features of the experiments, lending some support to their projections.",U51184461,"DIETZE, MICHAEL",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
43,MICHAEL DIETZE,Cutting out the middleman: calibrating and validating a dynamic vegetation model (ED2-PROSPECT5) using remotely sensed surface reflectance,"Ecosystem models are often calibrated and/or validated against derived remote sensing data products, such as MODIS leaf area index. However, these data products are generally based on their own models, whose assumptions may not be compatible with those of the ecosystem model in question, and whose uncertainties are usually not well quantified. Here, we develop an alternative approach whereby we modify an ecosystem model to predict full-range, high spectral resolution surface reflectance, which can then be compared directly against airborne and satellite data. Specifically, we coupled the two-stream representation of canopy radiative transfer in the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2) with a leaf radiative transfer model (PROSPECT 5) and a simple soil reflectance model. We then calibrated this model against reflectance observations from the NASA Airborne VIsible/InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and survey data from 54 temperate forest plots in the northeastern United States. The calibration successfully constrained the posterior distributions of model parameters related to leaf biochemistry and morphology and canopy structure for five plant functional types. The calibrated model was able to accurately reproduce surface reflectance and leaf area index for sites with highly varied forest composition and structure, using a single common set of parameters across all sites. We conclude that having dynamic vegetation models directly predict surface reflectance is a promising avenue for model calibration and validation using remote sensing data.",U51184461,"DIETZE, MICHAEL",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

46,NATHAN PHILLIPS,An enhanced procedure for urban mobile methane leak detection,"Leaked methane from natural gas distribution pipelines is a significant human and environmental health problem in urban areas. To assess this risk, urban mobile methane leak surveys were conducted, using innovative methodology, on the streets of Hartford, Danbury, and New London, Connecticut, in March 2019. The Hartford survey was done to determine if results from a 2016 survey (Keyes et al., 2019) were persistent, and surveys in additional towns were done to determine if similar findings could be made using an identical approach. Results show that Hartford continues to be problematic, with approximately 3.4 leaks per road mile observed in 2016 and 4.3 leaks per mile estimated in 2019, similar to that previously found in Boston, Massachusetts (Phillips et al., 2013). A preliminary estimate of methane leaks in Hartford is 0.86 metric tonnes per day (or 313 metric tonnes per year), equivalent to 42,840 cubic feet per day of natural gas, and a daily gas consumption of approximately 214 U.S. households. Moreover, the surveys and analyses done for Danbury and New London also reveal problematic leaks, particularly for Danbury with an estimated 3.6 leaks per mile. Although road miles covered in New London were more limited, the survey revealed leak-prone areas, albeit with a range of methane readings lower than those in Hartford and Danbury. Data collection methods for all studies is first reported here and are readily transferable to similar urban settings. This work demonstrates the actionable value that can be gained from data-driven evaluations of urban pipeline performance, and if supplemented with a map of leak-prone pipe geo-location, and information on pipeline operating pressures, will provide a spatial database facilitating proactive repair and replacement of leak-prone urban pipes, a considerable improvement compared to reactive mitigation of human-reported leaks. While this work pertains to the selected urban towns in the Northeast, it exemplifies issues and opportunities nationwide in the United States.",U12530379,"PHILLIPS, NATHAN",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
47,NATHAN PHILLIPS,Characterizing urban landscapes using fuzzy sets,"Characterizing urban landscapes is important given the present and future projections of global population that favor urban growth. The definition of “urban” on a thematic map has proven to be problematic since urban areas are heterogeneous in terms of land use and land cover. Further, certain urban classes are inherently imprecise due to the difficulty in integrating various social and environmental inputs into a precise definition. Social components often include demographic patterns, transportation, building type and density while ecological components include soils, elevation, hydrology, climate, vegetation and tree cover. In this paper, we adopt a coupled human and natural system (CHANS) integrated scientific framework for characterizing urban landscapes. We implement the framework by adopting a fuzzy sets concept of “urban characterization” since fuzzy sets relate to classes of object with imprecise boundaries in which membership is a matter of degree. For dynamic mapping applications, user-defined classification schemes involving rules combining different social and ecological inputs can lead to a degree of quantification in class labeling varying from “highly urban” to “least urban”. A socio-economic perspective of urban may include threshold values for population and road network density while a more ecological perspective of urban may utilize the ratio of natural versus built area and percent forest cover. Threshold values are defined to derive the fuzzy rules of membership, in each case, and various combinations of rules offer a greater flexibility to characterize the many facets of the urban landscape. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of this fuzzy inference approach called the Fuzzy Urban Index for the Boston Metro region with five inputs and eighteen rules. The resulting classification map shows levels of fuzzy membership ranging from highly urban to least urban or rural in the Boston study region. We validate our approach using two experts assessing accuracy of the resulting fuzzy urban map. We discuss how our approach can be applied in other urban contexts with newly emerging descriptors of urban sustainability, urban ecology and urban metabolism.",U12530379,"PHILLIPS, NATHAN",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
48,ANDREW W TAYLOR,"Caribbean Corals in Crisis: Record Thermal Stress, Bleaching, and Mortality in 2005","BACKGROUND. The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.",U50253645,"TAYLOR, ANDREW W",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
49,KEVIN GALLAGHER,Repositioning Chinese development finance in Latin America: opportunities for green finance,"China is one of the largest creditors of Latin American and the Caribbean and has loaned the region more than $125 billion since 2005. However, the composition of China’s financing in the region has been concentrated in commodity related sectors that are currently on the decline. This policy brief notes the extent to which Chinese finance is concentrated in new green economy sectors, and finds that China is not taking full opportunity of the potential in this sector. Moreover, as the global commodity boom has declined, much of China’s investments in the region have been exposed to significant risk, including prominent environmental and social risks. Despite great strides whereby the Chinese government has established a series of guidelines on greening overseas investment over the last few years, China’s development banks and companies are lacking the policies and staffing to identify and fully mitigate such risks. This policy brief reviews the green profile of Chinese development finance in LAC and analyzes environment related risks and policies for Chinese overseas investment. It also outlines the opportunities of green finance in LAC and how blending instruments can mobilize green financial flows that are beneficial for both China and LAC.",U49959284,"GALLAGHER, KEVIN",PARDEE SCHOOL OF GLOBAL STUDIES
50,KEVIN GALLAGHER,Exporting national champions: China’s OFDI finance in comparative perspective,"Scholars have compared China’s liberalization, inward FDI attraction, and export promotion policies to those of its ""Asian Miracle"" predecessors to assess China as a 'developmental state.' We build on that literature by drawing a new but similar comparison: the extent to which Chinese development banks have financed the globalization of China’s ‘national champion’ firms. We focus on the role of state finance in promoting China’s outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in comparative perspective. In order to answer this research question, we created a database of Chinese finance for OFDI and compared our results to the existing literature on previous developmental states. We estimate the total value of China’s OFDI finance from 2002‐2012 at $140 billion. As a percentage of total OFDI, China’s lending is roughly three times 55% higher than Japan, the previous global leader in OFDI finance. Like Japan and South Korea at earlier developmental stages, China’s lending also goes overwhelmingly toward natural resource acquisition, though to a much greater degree. Unlike Japan or Korea, we find that China’s market entry has more to do with developing project expertise and supporting exports than it does with tariff‐hopping or outsourcing industries that are fading on the mainland. We identify two major reasons for China’s high (31%) ratio of OFDI lending to total OFDI. First, China has a greater incentive to give OFDI loans than Japan or Korea ever did because its borrowers are state‐owned so it can more easily dictate how they use the money. Second, China has a greater capacity to give OFDI loans because it has significantly higher savings and foreign exchange reserves than Japan and Korea, both today and especially during equivalent developmental stages.",U49959284,"GALLAGHER, KEVIN",PARDEE SCHOOL OF GLOBAL STUDIES
51,KEVIN GALLAGHER,Housing price volatility and the capital account in China,"China experienced significant volatility in its housing market from 2005‐2013. Economists analyzing the determinants of volatility in these markets find that the bubble was largely been driven by factors specific to the Chinese economy and Chinese economic policy. In this paper, we examine the extent to which a) short-­‐ term capital flows may have further impacted the prices and volatility in the Chinese housing market and b) whether China’s 2006 Capital Account Regulations (CARs) on foreign purchases of Chinese real estate were effective in reducing the level and volatility of prices in China’s housing markets. According to our OLS baseline model, we find that short-­‐term capital flows from abroad had a modest impact on price increases in the Chinese housing market, but a more significant impact on increasing market volatility. In terms of Chinese 2006 CAR, the measures did not appear to have impact on reducing housing prices, but had a strong impact on reducing volatility in Chinese housing market. The results from a supplementary quantile regression analysis show that hot money magnified the impacts of capital flows on housing prices during upward surges in the housing price. In terms of market volatility, our quantile regressions suggest that the more volatile the housing market became, the larger the impact short-­‐term capital flows had on accentuating such volatility. Furthermore, we find that the 2006 CARs continued to have a strong impact on reducing volatility in the Chinese housing market during the period under study.",U49959284,"GALLAGHER, KEVIN",PARDEE SCHOOL OF GLOBAL STUDIES
52,KEVIN GALLAGHER,Fueling global energy finance: the emergence of China in global energy investment,"Global financial investments in energy production and consumption are significant since all aspects of a country’s economic activity and development require energy resources. In this paper, we assess the investment trends in the global energy sector during, before, and after the financial crisis of 2008 using two data sources: (1) The Dealogic database providing cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As); and (2) The “fDi Intelligence fDi Markets” database providing Greenfield (GF) foreign direct investments (FDIs). We highlight the changing role of China and compare its M&A and GF FDI activities to those of the United States, Germany, UK, Japan, and others during this period. We analyze the investments along each segment of the energy supply chain of these countries to highlight the geographical origin and destination, sectoral distribution, and cross-border M&As and GF FDI activities. Our paper shows that while energy accounts for nearly 25% of all GF FDI, it only accounts for 4.82% of total M&A FDI activity in the period 1996–2016. China’s outbound FDI in the energy sector started its ascent around the time of the global recession and accelerated in the post-recession phase. In the energy sector, China’s outbound cross-border M&As are similar to the USA or UK, located mostly in the developed countries of the West, while their outbound GF investments are spread across many countries around the world. Also, China’s outbound energy M&As are concentrated in certain segments of the energy supply chain (extraction, and electricity generation) while their GF FDI covers other segments (electricity generation and power/pipeline transmission) of the energy supply chain.",U49959284,"GALLAGHER, KEVIN",PARDEE SCHOOL OF GLOBAL STUDIES

Thorough impact evaluation of these environmental abuses—essential for conservation and future project planning—requires good analysis of local ecological and environmental data in addition to social and economic impacts. We characterized the deforestation and biodiversity impacts of energy investments in Southeast Asia using multiple geospatial data sources related to forest cover and loss data from 2000 to 2018, other landcover data, and the location, type, and characteristics of energy investments. This study paid particular attention to different types of power plants and financing sources. We identified critical buffer zones and forest structures impacted by these projects in accordance with IUCN criteria and spatial ecology. The paper introduces a novel, replicable analytical framework that goes beyond earlier studies in which all forests are treated as equivalent. It characterizes forests based on spatial morphological structures such as core forest, edges, islands, and bridges, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of deforestation and its impacts on biodiversity. Preliminary findings suggest that projects financed by Chinese development banks pose different risks compared to non-Chinese financing. The study also reveals significant differences in biodiversity impacts based on the type of energy source, be it coal or hydro. The study offers critical insights into the trade-offs between energy development and biodiversity conservation.

55,FERNANDO ZAPATERO,Clinging onto the cliff: a model of financial misconduct,"We propose a novel model of financial misconduct. In line with empirical evidence thereon, our model interprets white-collar crime as gambles with skewed payoffs, as opposed to Becker's analysis of criminal activity that postulates positive expected payoffs associated to crime. In our model, criminal motives arise as optimal responses to a ""tunnel vision"" that engross firm managers, whereby the intense pressure to attain the focused goal triggers strong demand for negatively skewed bets in the form of crime. The key mechanism is consistent with the notion of a ""slippery slope to crime"" that is finding growing support in the literature as well as in practitioner accounts. Comparative static analyses on the model reveal several empirical implications {for example, a ""pecking order of crime"" indicating that serious infringements will only follow the depletion of the more preferred (and possibly prevalent) option of milder incursions of law, e.g., minor violations of financial reporting standards - many of which find empirical support in the literature.",U48762175,"ZAPATERO, FERNANDO",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)

Using exact numerical simulations, we find a stable regime at large driving frequencies where the time evolution is governed by a local Floquet Hamiltonian that is approximately conserved out to very long times. For slow driving, on the other hand, the system becomes unstable and heats up to infinite temperature. While thermalization is relatively fast in these two regimes (but to different “temperatures”), in the crossover between them we find slow nonthermalizing time evolution: temporal fluctuations become strong and temporal correlations long lived. Microscopically, we trace back the origin of this nonthermalizing time evolution to the properties of rare Floquet many-body resonances, whose proliferation at lower driving frequency removes the approximate energy conservation, and thus produces thermalization to infinite temperature.",U47231797,"POLKOVNIKOV, ANATOLI",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

58,MICHAEL MCCLEAN,Heat stress and heat strain among outdoor workers in El Salvador and Nicaragua,"BACKGROUND: There is growing attention on occupational heat stress in Central America, as workers in this region are affected by a unique form of chronic kidney disease. Previous studies have examined wet bulb globe temperatures and estimated metabolic rates to assess heat stress, but there are limited data characterizing heat strain among these workers. OBJECTIVE: The aims were to characterize heat stress and heat strain and examine whether job task, break duration, hydration practices, and kidney function were associated with heat strain. METHODS: We used data from the MesoAmerican Nephropathy Occupational Study, a cohort of 569 outdoor workers in El Salvador and Nicaragua who underwent workplace exposure monitoring, including continuous measurement of core body temperature (Tc), heart rate (HR), physical activity, and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), over the course of three days in January 2018 - May 2018. Participants represented five industries: sugarcane, corn, plantain, brickmaking, and construction. RESULTS: Median WBGTs were relatively high (>27 °C) at most sites, particularly when work shifts spanned the afternoon hours (e.g., 29.2 °C among plantain workers). Sugarcane workers, especially cane cutters in both countries and Nicaraguan agrichemical applicators, had the highest estimated metabolic rates (medians: 299-318 kcal/hr). Most workers spent little time on break (<10% of the shift), as determined by physical activity data. Overall, sugarcane workers-particularly those in Nicaragua-experienced the highest Tc and HR values. However, a few workers in other industries reached high Tc (>39 °C) as well. Impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) was associated with higher Tc and HR values, even after adjustment. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the largest study to-date examining heat stress and strain among outdoor workers in Central America. Workers at sugar companies regularly experienced Tc > 38°C (76.9% of monitored person-days at Nicaraguan companies; 46.5% at Salvadoran companies). Workers with impaired kidney function had higher measures of Tc and HR. IMPACT STATEMENT: This study examined levels of occupational heat stress and heat strain experienced among outdoor workers in five industries in El Salvador and Nicaragua. We characterized heat stress using wet bulb globe temperatures and estimated metabolic rate and heat strain using core body temperature and heart rate. Sugarcane workers, particularly cane cutters and Nicaraguan agrichemical applicators, performed more strenuous work and experienced greater levels of heat strain. Impaired kidney function was associated with higher heart rates and core body temperatures.",U46459381,"MCCLEAN, MICHAEL",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
59,DANIEL SEGRE,Microbial carbon use efficiency predicted from genome-scale metabolic models,"Respiration by soil bacteria and fungi is one of the largest fluxes of carbon (C) from the land surface. Although this flux is a direct product of microbial metabolism, controls over metabolism and their responses to global change are a major uncertainty in the global C cycle. Here, we explore an in silico approach to predict bacterial C-use efficiency (CUE) for over 200 species using genome-specific constraint-based metabolic modeling. We find that potential CUE averages 0.62 ± 0.17 with a range of 0.22 to 0.98 across taxa and phylogenetic structuring at the subphylum levels. Potential CUE is negatively correlated with genome size, while taxa with larger genomes are able to access a wider variety of C substrates. Incorporating the range of CUE values reported here into a next-generation model of soil biogeochemistry suggests that these differences in physiology across microbial taxa can feed back on soil-C cycling.",U46068727,"SEGRE, DANIEL",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
60,MARK A FRIEDL,The role of land cover change in Arctic-Boreal greening and browning trends,"Many studies have used time series of satellite-derived vegetation indices to identify so-called greening and browning trends across the northern high-latitudes and to suggest that the productivity of Arctic-Boreal ecosystems is changing in response to climate forcing at local and continental scales. However, disturbances that alter land cover are prevalent in Arctic-Boreal ecosystems, and changes in Arctic-Boreal land cover, which complicate interpretation of trends in vegetation indices, have mostly been ignored in previous studies. Here we use a new land cover change dataset derived from Landsat imagery to explore the extent to which land cover and land cover change influence trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over a large (3.76 M km2) area of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment, which spans much of northwestern Canada and Alaska. Between 1984 and 2012, 21.2% of the study domain experienced land cover change and 42.7% had significant NDVI trends. Land cover change occurred in 27.6% of locations with significant NDVI trends during this period and resulted in greening and browning rates 48%–128% higher than in areas of stable land cover. While the majority of land cover change areas experienced significant NDVI trends, more than half of areas with stable land cover did not. Further, the extent and magnitude of browning and greening trends varied substantially as a function of land cover class and land cover change type. Forest disturbance from fire and timber harvest drove over one third of statistically significant NDVI trends and created complex mosaics of recent forest loss (as browning) and post-disturbance recovery (as greening) at both landscape and continental scale. Our results demonstrate the importance of land cover changes in highly disturbed high-latitude ecosystems for interpreting trends of NDVI and productivity across multiple spatial scales.",U43762387,"FRIEDL, MARK A",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
61,MARK A FRIEDL,Sensitivity of global pasturelands to climate variation,"Pasturelands are globally extensive, sensitive to climate, and support livestock production systems that provide an essential source of food in many parts of the world. In this paper, we integrate information from remote sensing, global climate, and land use databases to improve understanding of the resilience and resistance of this ecologically vulnerable and societally-critical land use. To characterize the effect of climate on pastureland productivity, we analyze the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation index and gridded precipitation datasets at 1 to 6-month time lags. To account for the effects of different production systems, we stratify our analysis by agroecological zone and by rangeland-based versus mixed crop-livestock system. Results show that 14.5% of global pasturelands experienced statistically significant greening or browning trends over the 15-year study period, with the majority of these locations showing greening. In arid ecosystems, precipitation and lagged vegetation index anomalies explain up to 69% of variation in vegetation productivity in both crop-livestock and rangeland-based production systems. Livestock production systems in Australia are least resistant to contemporaneous and short-term precipitation anomalies, while arid livestock production systems in Latin America are least resilient to short-term vegetation greenness anomalies. More generally, large swaths of semi-arid global pasturelands show substantial sensitivity to variation in precipitation, and hence, are vulnerable to climate change. Because many arid regions of the world are projected to experience decreased total precipitation and increased precipitation variability in the coming decades, improved understanding regarding the sensitivity of pasturelands to the joint effects of climate change and production system is required to support sustainable land management in global pasturelands.",U43762387,"FRIEDL, MARK A",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
62,MARK A FRIEDL,Using time series of MODIS land surface phenology to model temperature and photoperiod controls on spring greenup in North American deciduous forests,"The timing of leaf emergence in temperate and boreal forests is changing, which has profound implications for a wide array of ecosystem processes and services. Spring phenology models, which have been widely used to predict the timing of leaf emergence, generally assume that a combination of photoperiod and thermal forcing control when leaves emerge. However, the exact nature and magnitude of how photoperiod and temperature individually and jointly control leaf emergence is the subject of ongoing debate. Here we use a continuous development model in combination with time series of land surface phenology measurements from MODIS to quantify the relative importance of photoperiod and thermal forcing in controlling the timing of canopy greenup in eastern temperate and boreal forests of North America. The model accurately predicts biogeographic and interannual variation in the timing of greenup across the study region (median RMSE = 4.6 days, median bias = 0.30 days). Results reveal strong biogeographic variation in the period prior to greenup when temperature and photoperiod influence greenup that covaries with the importance of photoperiod versus thermal controls. Photoperiod control on leaf emergence is dominant in warmer climates, but exerts only modest influence on the timing of leaf emergence in colder climates. Results from models estimated using ground-based observations of cloned lilac are consistent with those from remote sensing, which supports the realism of remote sensing-based models. Overall, results from this study suggest that apparent changes in the sensitivity of trees to temperature are modest and reflect a trade-off between decreased sensitivity to temperature and increased photoperiod control, and identify a transition in the relative importance of temperature versus photoperiod near the 10 °C isotherm in mean annual temperature. This suggests that the timing of leaf emergence will continue to move earlier as the climate warms, and that the magnitude of change will be more pronounced in colder regions with mean annual temperatures below 10 °C.",U43762387,"FRIEDL, MARK A",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
63,MARK A FRIEDL,Widespread changes in 21st century vegetation cover in the Southern Cone of South America,"South America has been an epicenter of land cover and land use change (LCLUC) for over five decades due to rapid agricultural expansion along forest frontiers, the establishment of plantations in savannas, and desertification in drylands. Most attention has focused on LCLUC in tropical forests, and so information regarding the magnitude, geography, and rate of LCLUC across the Southern Cone region (SCR) of South America is incomplete. To address this, we used Landsat to map changes in the fractional cover of bare ground, woody cover, and herbaceous vegetation at annual time steps from 1999 to 2019 over the SCR. Using field observations and Landsat imagery, we created a spectral library representative of these three cover types. We trained a machine learning model to map annual fractional cover at 30-meter spatial resolution, and used a Bayesian change point algorithm to characterize spatial and temporal trajectories of LCLUC. Our results reveal substantial changes in land cover composition over the SCR between 1999 and 2019, totaling 389,973.2 km2, equivalent to 11.6% of the study domain. Herbaceous cover in Paraguay increased by 51%, mostly because of deforestation for cattle ranching in the Dry Chaco and commodity crop agriculture in the Atlantic Forest. Uruguay showed a 62% increase in woody cover arising from the emergence and growth of pine and eucalyptus plantations. Argentina, the largest and most heterogeneous of the three countries, experienced a 38% increase in bare ground in the Patagonian Steppe due to climate and anthropogenic drivers, including reduced precipitation. Quantification of these abrupt and gradual LCLUC processes can be used to improve models of the carbon budget in the SCR and to measure carbon exchange in arid and semi-arid ecoregions, as they are increasingly understood to be important drivers of the interannual variability of the global carbon cycle.",U43762387,"FRIEDL, MARK A",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

The field observations are grouped into classes including urban, reduced productivity agriculture, agriculture in delta, desert/coast reclamation, wetland reclamation, and agriculture in desert/coast. Reclamation classes represent land use changes. A particular challenge posed by this database is the unequal representation of various land use categories: urban and agriculture in delta pixels comprise the vast majority of the ground truth data available in the database. A new, two-step training data selection method was introduced to enable unbiased training of neural network systems on sites with unequal numbers of pixels. Data were successfully classified by using multi-date feature vectors containing data from all of the available satellite images as inputs to the neural network system.",U14426328,"GOPAL, SUCHARITA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
67,SUCHARITA GOPAL,Characterizing urban landscapes using fuzzy sets,"Characterizing urban landscapes is important given the present and future projections of global population that favor urban growth. The definition of “urban” on a thematic map has proven to be problematic since urban areas are heterogeneous in terms of land use and land cover. Further, certain urban classes are inherently imprecise due to the difficulty in integrating various social and environmental inputs into a precise definition. Social components often include demographic patterns, transportation, building type and density while ecological components include soils, elevation, hydrology, climate, vegetation and tree cover. In this paper, we adopt a coupled human and natural system (CHANS) integrated scientific framework for characterizing urban landscapes. We implement the framework by adopting a fuzzy sets concept of “urban characterization” since fuzzy sets relate to classes of object with imprecise boundaries in which membership is a matter of degree. For dynamic mapping applications, user-defined classification schemes involving rules combining different social and ecological inputs can lead to a degree of quantification in class labeling varying from “highly urban” to “least urban”. A socio-economic perspective of urban may include threshold values for population and road network density while a more ecological perspective of urban may utilize the ratio of natural versus built area and percent forest cover. Threshold values are defined to derive the fuzzy rules of membership, in each case, and various combinations of rules offer a greater flexibility to characterize the many facets of the urban landscape. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of this fuzzy inference approach called the Fuzzy Urban Index for the Boston Metro region with five inputs and eighteen rules. The resulting classification map shows levels of fuzzy membership ranging from highly urban to least urban or rural in the Boston study region. We validate our approach using two experts assessing accuracy of the resulting fuzzy urban map. We discuss how our approach can be applied in other urban contexts with newly emerging descriptors of urban sustainability, urban ecology and urban metabolism.",U14426328,"GOPAL, SUCHARITA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
68,SUCHARITA GOPAL,Fueling global energy finance: the emergence of China in global energy investment,"Global financial investments in energy production and consumption are significant since all aspects of a country’s economic activity and development require energy resources. In this paper, we assess the investment trends in the global energy sector during, before, and after the financial crisis of 2008 using two data sources: (1) The Dealogic database providing cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As); and (2) The “fDi Intelligence fDi Markets” database providing Greenfield (GF) foreign direct investments (FDIs). We highlight the changing role of China and compare its M&A and GF FDI activities to those of the United States, Germany, UK, Japan, and others during this period. We analyze the investments along each segment of the energy supply chain of these countries to highlight the geographical origin and destination, sectoral distribution, and cross-border M&As and GF FDI activities. Our paper shows that while energy accounts for nearly 25% of all GF FDI, it only accounts for 4.82% of total M&A FDI activity in the period 1996–2016. China’s outbound FDI in the energy sector started its ascent around the time of the global recession and accelerated in the post-recession phase. In the energy sector, China’s outbound cross-border M&As are similar to the USA or UK, located mostly in the developed countries of the West, while their outbound GF investments are spread across many countries around the world. Also, China’s outbound energy M&As are concentrated in certain segments of the energy supply chain (extraction, and electricity generation) while their GF FDI covers other segments (electricity generation and power/pipeline transmission) of the energy supply chain.",U14426328,"GOPAL, SUCHARITA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

We use the lens of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to determine potential policies to address LULCC due to increasing population, suburbia, and rubber plantations in Semarang, Indonesia between 2006 and 2015. Using remote sensing, overlay analysis, optimized hot spot analysis, expert validation, and Continuous Change Detection and Classification, we found that there was a spread of urban landscapes towards the southern and western portions of Semarang that had previously been occupied by forests, plantations, agriculture, and aquaculture. We also witnessed a transition in farming from agriculture to rubber plantations, a cash crop. The implications of this study show that these geospatial analyses and big data can be used to characterize the SDGs, the complex interplay of these goals, and potentially alleviate some of the conflicts between disparate SDGs. We recommend certain policies that can assist in preserving the terrestrial ecosystem of Semarang (SDG 15) while creating a sustainable city (SDG 11, SDG 9) and providing sufficient work for individuals (SDG 1) in a growing economy (SDG 8) while simultaneously maintaining a sufficient food supply (SDG 2).",U14426328,"GOPAL, SUCHARITA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
70,SUCHARITA GOPAL,Geographically weighted regression models in estimating median home prices in towns of Massachusetts based on an urban sustainability framework,"Housing is a key component of urban sustainability. The objective of this study was to assess the significance of key spatial determinants of median home price in towns in Massachusetts that impact sustainable growth. Our analysis investigates the presence or absence of spatial non-stationarity in the relationship between sustainable growth, measured in terms of the relationship between home values and various parameters including the amount of unprotected forest land, residential land, unemployment, education, vehicle ownership, accessibility to commuter rail stations, school district performance, and senior population. We use the standard geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Mixed GWR models to analyze the effects of spatial non-stationarity. Mixed GWR performed better than GWR in terms of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values. Our findings highlight the nature and spatial extent of the non-stationary vs. stationary qualities of key environmental and social determinants of median home price. Understanding the key determinants of housing values, such as valuation of green spaces, public school performance metrics, and proximity to public transport, enable towns to use different strategies of sustainable urban planning, while understanding urban housing determinants—such as unemployment and senior population—can help modify urban sustainable housing policies.",U14426328,"GOPAL, SUCHARITA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
71,SUCHARITA GOPAL,The deforestation and biodiversity risks of power plant projects in Southeast Asia: a big data spatial analytical framework,"Ecosystem destruction and biodiversity loss are now widespread, extremely rapid, and among the top global anthropogenic risks both in terms of likelihood and overall impact. Thorough impact evaluation of these environmental abuses—essential for conservation and future project planning—requires good analysis of local ecological and environmental data in addition to social and economic impacts. We characterized the deforestation and biodiversity impacts of energy investments in Southeast Asia using multiple geospatial data sources related to forest cover and loss data from 2000 to 2018, other landcover data, and the location, type, and characteristics of energy investments. This study paid particular attention to different types of power plants and financing sources. We identified critical buffer zones and forest structures impacted by these projects in accordance with IUCN criteria and spatial ecology. The paper introduces a novel, replicable analytical framework that goes beyond earlier studies in which all forests are treated as equivalent. It characterizes forests based on spatial morphological structures such as core forest, edges, islands, and bridges, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of deforestation and its impacts on biodiversity. Preliminary findings suggest that projects financed by Chinese development banks pose different risks compared to non-Chinese financing. The study also reveals significant differences in biodiversity impacts based on the type of energy source, be it coal or hydro. The study offers critical insights into the trade-offs between energy development and biodiversity conservation. It provides actionable metrics and strategies for policymakers, conservationists, and development banks to prioritize forest and habitat preservation in Southeast Asia and globally.",U14426328,"GOPAL, SUCHARITA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
72,JONATHAN I LEVY,Evaluation of the Public Health Impacts of Traffic Congestion: A Health Risk Assessment,"BACKGROUND: Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban areas in the United States and around the world. Previous analyses have estimated the economic costs of congestion, related to fuel and time wasted, but few have quantified the public health impacts or determined how these impacts compare in magnitude to the economic costs. Moreover, the relative magnitudes of economic and public health impacts of congestion would be expected to vary significantly across urban areas, as a function of road infrastructure, population density, and atmospheric conditions influencing pollutant formation, but this variability has not been explored. METHODS: In this study, we evaluate the public health impacts of ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations associated with a business-as-usual scenario of predicted traffic congestion. We evaluate 83 individual urban areas using traffic demand models to estimate the degree of congestion in each area from 2000 to 2030. We link traffic volume and speed data with the MOBILE6 model to characterize emissions of PM2.5 and particle precursors attributable to congestion, and we use a source-receptor matrix to evaluate the impact of these emissions on ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Marginal concentration changes are related to a concentration-response function for mortality, with a value of statistical life approach used to monetize the impacts. RESULTS: We estimate that the monetized value of PM2.5-related mortality attributable to congestion in these 83 cities in 2000 was approximately $31 billion (2007 dollars), as compared with a value of time and fuel wasted of $60 billion. In future years, the economic impacts grow (to over $100 billion in 2030) while the public health impacts decrease to $13 billion in 2020 before increasing to $17 billion in 2030, given increasing population and congestion but lower emissions per vehicle. Across cities and years, the public health impacts range from more than an order of magnitude less to in excess of the economic impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that the public health impacts of congestion may be significant enough in magnitude, at least in some urban areas, to be considered in future evaluations of the benefits of policies to mitigate congestion.",U40758277,"LEVY, JONATHAN I",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
73,JONATHAN I LEVY,Nitrogen dioxide concentrations in neighborhoods adjacent to a commercial airport: a land use regression modeling study,"BACKGROUND: There is growing concern in communities surrounding airports regarding the contribution of various emission sources (such as aircraft and ground support equipment) to nearby ambient concentrations. We used extensive monitoring of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in neighborhoods surrounding T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, RI, and land-use regression (LUR) modeling techniques to determine the impact of proximity to the airport and local traffic on these concentrations. METHODS: Palmes diffusion tube samplers were deployed along the airport's fence line and within surrounding neighborhoods for one to two weeks. In total, 644 measurements were collected over three sampling campaigns (October 2007, March 2008 and June 2008) and each sampling location was geocoded. GIS-based variables were created as proxies for local traffic and airport activity. A forward stepwise regression methodology was employed to create general linear models (GLMs) of NO2 variability near the airport. The effect of local meteorology on associations with GIS-based variables was also explored. RESULTS: Higher concentrations of NO2 were seen near the airport terminal, entrance roads to the terminal, and near major roads, with qualitatively consistent spatial patterns between seasons. In our final multivariate model (R2 = 0.32), the local influences of highways and arterial/collector roads were statistically significant, as were local traffic density and distance to the airport terminal (all p < 0.001). Local meteorology did not significantly affect associations with principal GIS variables, and the regression model structure was robust to various model-building approaches. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that there are clear local variations in NO2 in the neighborhoods that surround an urban airport, which are spatially consistent across seasons. LUR modeling demonstrated a strong influence of local traffic, except the smallest roads that predominate in residential areas, as well as proximity to the airport terminal.",U40758277,"LEVY, JONATHAN I",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
74,ROBERT A MARGO,Industrialization and urbanization in nineteenth century America,"During the nineteenth century manufacturing increased its share of the labor force in the United States, and manufacturing became more urban, as did the population. Our survey of the literature and analyses of census data suggests that a key reason was the development of a nationwide transportation system, especially the railroad. Coupled with changes in manufacturing technology and organizational form, the “transportation revolution” increased demand for manufacturing labor in urban locations. Labor supply responded and because of agglomeration economies, population density and the size and number of urban places increased. Although our focus is on the US experience, a causal role for transportation is likely for other economies that experienced historical industrialization and urbanization.",U36576319,"MARGO, ROBERT A",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

METHODS: To assess the extent to which such association persisted in the decade following its initial observation, we conducted a population-based case-control study encompassing forty-one newly-diagnosed cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and eighty-two age- and sex-matched controls. We measured long-term intake of inorganic selenium along with other potentially neurotoxic trace elements. RESULTS: We found that consumption of drinking water containing ≥ 1 μg/l of inorganic selenium was associated with a relative risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of 5.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1-26) after adjustment for confounding factors. Greater amounts of cumulative inorganic selenium intake were associated with progressively increasing effects, with a relative risk of 2.1 (95% confidence interval 0.5-9.1) for intermediate levels of cumulative intake and 6.4 (95% confidence interval 1.3-31) for high intake. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, coupled with other epidemiologic data and with findings from animal studies that show specific toxicity of the trace element on motor neurons, we hypothesize that dietary intake of inorganic selenium through drinking water increases the risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",U15955267,"ROTHMAN, KENNETH J",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
76,ANN ASCHENGRAU,Breast Cancer Risk and Drinking Water Contaminated by Wastewater: A Case Control Study,"BACKGROUND: Drinking water contaminated by wastewater is a potential source of exposure to mammary carcinogens and endocrine disrupting compounds from commercial products and excreted natural and pharmaceutical hormones. These contaminants are hypothesized to increase breast cancer risk. Cape Cod, Massachusetts, has a history of wastewater contamination in many, but not all, of its public water supplies; and the region has a history of higher breast cancer incidence that is unexplained by the population's age, in-migration, mammography use, or established breast cancer risk factors. We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether exposure to drinking water contaminated by wastewater increases the risk of breast cancer. METHODS: Participants were 824 Cape Cod women diagnosed with breast cancer in 1988–1995 and 745 controls who lived in homes served by public drinking water supplies and never lived in a home served by a Cape Cod private well. We assessed each woman's exposure yearly since 1972 at each of her Cape Cod addresses, using nitrate nitrogen (nitrate-N) levels measured in public wells and pumping volumes for the wells. Nitrate-N is an established wastewater indicator in the region. As an alternative drinking water quality indicator, we calculated the fraction of recharge zones in residential, commercial, and pesticide land use areas. RESULTS: After controlling for established breast cancer risk factors, mammography, and length of residence on Cape Cod, results showed no consistent association between breast cancer and average annual nitrate-N (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 0.6 – 5.0 for ≥ 1.2 vs. < .3 mg/L), the sum of annual nitrate-N concentrations (OR = 0.9; 95% CI 0.6 – 1.5 for ≥ 10 vs. 1 to < 10 mg/L), or the number of years exposed to nitrate-N over 1 mg/L (OR = 0.9; 95% CI 0.5 – 1.5 for ≥ 8 vs. 0 years). Variation in exposure levels was limited, with 99% of women receiving some of their water from supplies with nitrate-N levels in excess of background. The total fraction of residential, commercial, and pesticide use land in recharge zones of public supply wells was associated with a small statistically unstable higher breast cancer incidence (OR = 1.4; 95% CI 0.8–2.4 for highest compared with lowest land use), but risk did not increase for increasing land use fractions. CONCLUSION: Results did not provide evidence of an association between breast cancer and drinking water contaminated by wastewater. The computer mapping methods used in this study to link routine measurements required by the Safe Drinking Water Act with interview data can enhance individual-level epidemiologic studies of multiple health outcomes, including diseases with substantial latency.",U34046067,"ASCHENGRAU, ANN",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
77,ANN ASCHENGRAU,Using Residential History and Groundwater Modeling to Examine Drinking Water Exposure and Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND. Spatial analyses of case-control data have suggested a possible link between breast cancer and groundwater plumes in upper Cape Cod, Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE. We integrated residential histories, public water distribution systems, and groundwater modeling within geographic information systems (GIS) to examine the association between exposure to drinking water that has been contaminated by wastewater effluent and breast cancer. METHODS. Exposure was assessed from 1947 to 1993 for 638 breast cancer cases who were diagnosed from 1983 to 1993 and 842 controls; we took into account residential mobility and drinking water source. To estimate the historical impact of effluent on drinking water wells, we modified a modular three-dimensional finite-difference groundwater model (MODFLOW) from the U.S. Geological Survey. The analyses included latency and exposure duration. RESULTS. Wastewater effluent impacted the drinking water wells of study participants as early as 1966. For > 0-5 years of exposure (versus no exposure), associations were generally null. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for > 10 years of exposure were slightly increased, assuming latency periods of 0 or 10 years [AOR = 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-1.9 and AOR = 1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-3.2, respectively]. Statistically significant associations were estimated for ever-exposed versus never-exposed women when a 20-year latency period was assumed (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.4). A sensitivity analysis that classified exposures assuming lower well-pumping rates showed similar results. CONCLUSION. We investigated the hypothesis generated by earlier spatial analyses that exposure to drinking water contaminated by wastewater effluent may be associated with breast cancer. Using a detailed exposure assessment, we found an association with breast cancer that increased with longer latency and greater exposure duration.",U34046067,"ASCHENGRAU, ANN",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
78,ANN ASCHENGRAU,Evaluation of the Webler-Brown Model for Estimating Tetrachloroethylene Exposure from Vinyl-Lined Asbestos-Cement Pipes,"BACKGROUND: From May 1968 through March 1980, vinyl-lined asbestos-cement (VL/AC) water distribution pipes were installed in New England to avoid taste and odor problems associated with asbestos-cement pipes. The vinyl resin was applied to the inner pipe surface in a solution of tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE). Substantial amounts of PCE remained in the liner and subsequently leached into public drinking water supplies. METHODS: Once aware of the leaching problem and prior to remediation (April-November 1980), Massachusetts regulators collected drinking water samples from VL/AC pipes to determine the extent and severity of the PCE contamination. This study compares newly obtained historical records of PCE concentrations in water samples (n = 88) with concentrations estimated using an exposure model employed in epidemiologic studies on the cancer risk associated with PCE-contaminated drinking water. The exposure model was developed by Webler and Brown to estimate the mass of PCE delivered to subjects' residences. RESULTS: The mean and median measured PCE concentrations in the water samples were 66 and 0.5 μg/L, respectively, and the range extended from non-detectable to 2432 μg/L. The model-generated concentration estimates and water sample concentrations were moderately correlated (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.48, p < 0.0001). Correlations were higher in samples taken at taps and spigots vs. hydrants (ρ = 0.84 vs. 0.34), in areas with simple vs. complex geometry (ρ = 0.51 vs. 0.38), and near pipes installed in 1973–1976 vs. other years (ρ = 0.56 vs. 0.42 for 1968–1972 and 0.37 for 1977–1980). Overall, 24% of the variance in measured PCE concentrations was explained by the model-generated concentration estimates (p < 0.0001). Almost half of the water samples had undetectable concentrations of PCE. Undetectable levels were more common in areas with the earliest installed VL/AC pipes, at the beginning and middle of VL/AC pipes, at hydrants, and in complex pipe configurations. CONCLUSION: PCE concentration estimates generated using the Webler-Brown model were moderately correlated with measured water concentrations. The present analysis suggests that the exposure assessment process used in prior epidemiological studies could be improved with more accurate characterization of water flow. This study illustrates one method of validating an exposure model in an epidemiological study when historical measurements are not available.",U34046067,"ASCHENGRAU, ANN",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
79,ANN ASCHENGRAU,Impact of Tetrachloroethylene-Contaminated Drinking Water on the Risk of Breast Cancer: Using a Dose Model to Assess Exposure in a Case-Control Study,"BACKGROUND: A population-based case-control study was undertaken in 1997 to investigate the association between tetrachloroethylene (PCE) exposure from public drinking water and breast cancer among permanent residents of the Cape Cod region of Massachusetts. PCE, a volatile organic chemical, leached from the vinyl lining of certain water distribution pipes into drinking water from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. The measure of exposure in the original study, referred to as the relative delivered dose (RDD), was based on an amount of PCE in the tap water entering the home and estimated with a mathematical model that involved only characteristics of the distribution system. METHODS: In the current analysis, we constructed a personal delivered dose (PDD) model that included personal information on tap water consumption and bathing habits so that inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption were also considered. We reanalyzed the association between PCE and breast cancer and compared the results to the original RDD analysis of subjects with complete data. RESULTS: The PDD model produced higher adjusted odds ratios than the RDD model for exposures > 50th and >75th percentile when shorter latency periods were considered, and for exposures < 50th and >90th percentile when longer latency periods were considered. Overall, however, the results from the PDD analysis did not differ greatly from the RDD analysis. CONCLUSION: The inputs that most heavily influenced the PDD model were initial water concentration and duration of exposure. These variables were also included in the RDD model. In this study population, personal factors like bath and shower temperature, bathing frequencies and durations, and water consumption did not differ greatly among subjects, so including this information in the model did not significantly change subjects' exposure classification.",U34046067,"ASCHENGRAU, ANN",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
80,MARK W MILLER,"Caribbean Corals in Crisis: Record Thermal Stress, Bleaching, and Mortality in 2005","BACKGROUND. The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.",U29232435,"MILLER, MARK W",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

82,MUHAMMAD H ZAMAN,Compressive remodeling alters fluid transport properties of collagen networks - implications for tumor growth,"Biomechanical alterations to the tumor microenvironment include accumulation of solid stresses, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening and increased fluid pressure in both interstitial and peri-tumoral spaces. The relationship between interstitial fluid pressurization and ECM remodeling in vascularized tumors is well characterized, while earlier biomechanical changes occurring during avascular tumor growth within the peri-tumoral ECM remain poorly understood. Type I collagen, the primary fibrous ECM constituent, bears load in tension while it buckles under compression. We hypothesized that tumor-generated compressive forces cause collagen remodeling via densification which in turn creates a barrier to convective fluid transport and may play a role in tumor progression and malignancy. To better understand this process, we characterized the structure-function relationship of collagen networks under compression both experimentally and computationally. Here we show that growth of epithelial cancers induces compressive remodeling of the ECM, documented in the literature as a TACS-2 phenotype, which represents a localized densification and tangential alignment of peri-tumoral collagen. Such compressive remodeling is caused by the unique features of collagen network mechanics, such as fiber buckling and cross-link rupture, and reduces the overall hydraulic permeability of the matrix.",U27247837,"ZAMAN, MUHAMMAD H",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
83,RICHARD PRIMACK,Siberian plants shift their phenology in response to climate change,"Siberia has undergone dramatic climatic changes due to global warming in recent decades. Yet, the ecological responses to these climatic changes are still poorly understood due to a lack of data. Here, we use a unique data set from the Russian 'Chronicles of Nature' network to analyse the long-term (1976-2018) phenological shifts in leaf out, flowering, fruiting and senescence of 67 common Siberian plant species. We find that Siberian boreal forest plants advanced their early season (leaf out and flowering) and mid-season (fruiting) phenology by -2.2, -0.7 and -1.6 days/decade, and delayed the onset of senescence by 1.6 days/decade during this period. These mean values, however, are subject to substantial intraspecific variability, which is partly explained by the plants' growth forms. Trees and shrubs advanced leaf out and flowering (-3.1 and -3.3. days/decade) faster than herbs (-1 day/decade), presumably due to the more direct exposure of leaf and flower buds to ambient air for the woody vegetation. For senescence, we detected a reverse pattern: stronger delays in herbs (2.1 days/decade) than in woody plants (1.0-1.2 days/decade), presumably due to the stronger effects of autumn frosts on the leaves of herbs. Interestingly, the timing of fruiting in all four growth forms advanced at similar paces, from 1.4 days/decade in shrubs to 1.7 days/decade in trees and herbs. Our findings point to a strong, yet heterogeneous, response of Siberian plant phenology to recent global warming. Furthermore, the results highlight that species- and growth form-specific differences among study species could be used to identify plants particularly at risk of decline due to their low adaptive capacity or a loss of synchronization with important interaction partners.",U25816594,"PRIMACK, RICHARD",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

85,RICHARD PRIMACK,Taking the pulse of Earth's tropical forests using networks of highly distributed plots,"Tropical forests are the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science. In the future, humanity can benefit greatly by nurturing the grassroots communities now collectively capable of generating unique, long-term understanding of Earth's most precious forests.",U25816594,"PRIMACK, RICHARD",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

During the era of primordial nucleosynthesis the light elements ²H, ³He, ⁴He, and ⁷Li were produced in significant amounts and these abundances have since been modified primarily by stars. Observations of ³He⁺ in H II regions located throughout the Milky Way disk reveal very little variation in the ³He/H abundance ratio -- the ""³He Plateau"" -- indicating that the net effect of ³He production in stars is negligible. This is in contrast to much higher ³He/H abundance ratios reported for some planetary nebulae. This discrepancy is known as the ""³He Problem"". We use radio recombination lines observed simultaneously with the ³He⁺ transition to make a robust assessment of the spectral sensitivity that these observations achieve. We detect spectral lines at ∼ 1 -- 2 mK intensities, but at these levels instrumental effects compromise our ability to measure accurate spectral line parameters.

This result calls into question all reported detections of ³He⁺ emission from any planetary nebula.

87,LEE M WETZLER,Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) and Survival in a Vaccine Mouse Model of Tularemia,"BACKGROUND. Francisella tularensis causes severe pulmonary disease, and nasal vaccination could be the ideal measure to effectively prevent it. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this type of vaccine is influenced by the lack of an effective mucosal adjuvant. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Mice were immunized via the nasal route with lipopolysaccharide isolated from F. tularensis and neisserial recombinant PorB as an adjuvant candidate. Then, mice were challenged via the same route with the F. tularensis attenuated live vaccine strain (LVS). Mouse survival and analysis of a number of immune parameters were conducted following intranasal challenge. Vaccination induced a systemic antibody response and 70% of mice were protected from challenge as showed by their improved survival and weight regain. Lungs from mice recovering from infection presented prominent lymphoid aggregates in peribronchial and perivascular areas, consistent with the location of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). BALT areas contained proliferating B and T cells, germinal centers, T cell infiltrates, dendritic cells (DCs). We also observed local production of antibody generating cells and homeostatic chemokines in BALT areas. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that PorB might be an optimal adjuvant candidate for improving the protective effect of F. tularensis antigens. The presence of BALT induced after intranasal challenge in vaccinated mice might play a role in regulation of local immunity and long-term protection, but more work is needed to elucidate mechanisms that lead to its formation.",U24219741,"WETZLER, LEE M",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
88,GREGORY WELLENIUS,Inequality in the availability of residential air conditioning across 115 US metropolitan areas,"Continued climate change is increasing the frequency, severity, and duration of populations' high temperature exposures. Indoor cooling is a key adaptation, especially in urban areas, where heat extremes are intensified-the urban heat island effect (UHI)-making residential air conditioning (AC) availability critical to protecting human health. In the United States, the differences in residential AC prevalence from one metropolitan area to another is well understood, but its intra-urban variation is poorly characterized, obscuring neighborhood-scale variability in populations' heat vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We address this gap by constructing empirically derived probabilities of residential AC for 45,995 census tracts across 115 metropolitan areas. Within cities, AC is unequally distributed, with census tracts in the urban ""core"" exhibiting systematically lower prevalence than their suburban counterparts. Moreover, this disparity correlates strongly with multiple indicators of social vulnerability and summer daytime surface UHI intensity, highlighting the challenges that vulnerable urban populations face in adapting to climate-change driven heat stress amplification.",U19041438,"WELLENIUS, GREGORY",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
89,ROBERT KAUFMANN,Sensitivity of global pasturelands to climate variation,"Pasturelands are globally extensive, sensitive to climate, and support livestock production systems that provide an essential source of food in many parts of the world. In this paper, we integrate information from remote sensing, global climate, and land use databases to improve understanding of the resilience and resistance of this ecologically vulnerable and societally-critical land use. To characterize the effect of climate on pastureland productivity, we analyze the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation index and gridded precipitation datasets at 1 to 6-month time lags. To account for the effects of different production systems, we stratify our analysis by agroecological zone and by rangeland-based versus mixed crop-livestock system. Results show that 14.5% of global pasturelands experienced statistically significant greening or browning trends over the 15-year study period, with the majority of these locations showing greening. In arid ecosystems, precipitation and lagged vegetation index anomalies explain up to 69% of variation in vegetation productivity in both crop-livestock and rangeland-based production systems. Livestock production systems in Australia are least resistant to contemporaneous and short-term precipitation anomalies, while arid livestock production systems in Latin America are least resilient to short-term vegetation greenness anomalies. More generally, large swaths of semi-arid global pasturelands show substantial sensitivity to variation in precipitation, and hence, are vulnerable to climate change. Because many arid regions of the world are projected to experience decreased total precipitation and increased precipitation variability in the coming decades, improved understanding regarding the sensitivity of pasturelands to the joint effects of climate change and production system is required to support sustainable land management in global pasturelands.",U20990947,"KAUFMANN, ROBERT",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

This information is important for ecological protection, carbon accounting, climate mitigation and restoration efforts of dryland ecosystems15-18. We assessed more than 9.9 billion trees derived from more than 300,000 satellite images, covering semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa north of the Equator. We attributed wood, foliage and root carbon to every tree in the 0-1,000 mm year-1 rainfall zone by coupling field data19, machine learning20-22, satellite data and high-performance computing. Average carbon stocks of individual trees ranged from 0.54 Mg C ha-1 and 63 kg C tree-1 in the arid zone to 3.7 Mg C ha-1 and 98 kg tree-1 in the sub-humid zone. Overall, we estimated the total carbon for our study area to be 0.84 (±19.8%) Pg C. Comparisons with 14 previous TRENDY numerical simulation studies23 for our area found that the density and carbon stocks of scattered trees have been underestimated by three models and overestimated by 11 models, respectively. This benchmarking can help understand the carbon cycle and address concerns about land degradation24-29.

93,JEFFREY FURMAN,Social globalization and design innovation,"While designs play a critical role in corporate innovation and business operations, the determinants of design innovation (i.e., new aesthetic or stylistic forms) are largely underexplored in the literature. Accumulating evidence suggests that openness to the exchange of ideas, the adoption of progressive policies, and the circulation of human capital play significant roles in driving regional innovative activities. In this study, we ask a variation of this question: Is there evidence that social globalization, i.e., “the spread of ideas, information, images and people” (Dreher et al., 2008, p. 43) – can drive the extent of national design innovation? We leverage a survey instrument reporting on globalization levels, the KOF Globalization Index, to measure national levels of social globalization. We find that national levels of social globalization predict design innovation, as measured by the number of annual design awards granted by the Industrie Forum (iF) over the period 1973-2015. To address the potential endogeneity in our analysis, we instrument for social globalization using a differences-in-differences approach and an instrumental variable approach. Our findings remain robust when we use U.S. design patents as an alternative measure for design innovation.

In general, the equatorial central Pacific lacks biogeographic perspective on deep-sea benthic communities compared to more well-studied regions of the North and South Pacific Ocean. In 2017, explorations by the NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer and R/V Falkor were among the first to document the diversity and distribution of deep-water benthic megafauna on numerous seamounts, islands, shallow coral reef banks, and atolls in the region. Here, we present baseline deep-sea coral species distribution and community assembly patterns within the Scleractinia, Octocorallia, Antipatharia, and Zoantharia with respect to different seafloor features and abiotic environmental variables across bathyal depths (200–2500 m). Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) transects were performed on 17 features throughout the Phoenix Islands and Tokelau Ridge Seamounts resulting in the observation of 12,828 deep-water corals and 167 identifiable morphospecies. Anthozoan assemblages were largely octocoral-dominated consisting of 78% of all observations with seamounts having a greater number of observed morphospecies compared to other feature types. Overlying water masses were observed to have significant effects on community assembly across bathyal depths. Revised species inventories further suggest that the protected area it is an area of biogeographic overlap for Pacific deep-water corals, containing species observed across bathyal provinces in the North Pacific, Southwest Pacific, and Western Pacific. These results underscore significant geographic and environmental complexity associated with deep-sea coral communities that remain in under-characterized in the equatorial central Pacific, but also highlight the additional efforts that need to be brought forth to effectively establish baseline ecological metrics in data deficient bathyal provinces.",U96665062,"AUSCAVITCH, STEVEN",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
95,KARINA SCAVO,"The importance of mangroves as coral habitat in a deteriorating ocean – an ecological, demographic, and genomic research program on model mangrove corals in the genus Porites","Coral reefs and many of the coral species that construct them are in a state of global decline, and this rapid decline of reef corals has incited worldwide conservation, restoration, and research efforts. One growing area of research involves exploring the value of reef-associated habitats, like mangroves, for the survival of particular coral species and the resilience of nearby reefs. Mangroves have long been regarded as inhospitable habitat for corals due to their combination of low light levels, low water clarity, and fluctuating water temperatures. However, roughly half of the coral species living on Caribbean reefs have been documented to inhabit mangrove habitats. If mangroves constitute a critical component of the ecological niche for some corals, then they should support viable, self-sustaining populations. If mangroves contribute directly to the resilience of reef coral populations, then corals must be able to exploit both habitat types coping with varying environmental conditions. Despite the growing number of documented mangrove-coral communities, these questions have not been studied. Here I use two Caribbean coral species from the genus Porites that are known to inhabit both reef and mangrove habitats (P. astreoides and P. divaricata) to explore the contribution of mangrove habitats to coral survival via the following objectives: 1) Characterize the survival, growth, and spatial-distribution of a mangrove-dwelling population of P. divaricata through a multi-year field study; 2) Determine if the population characterized in objective 1 is capable of self-recruitment and map dispersal through a population genomic study using 2bRAD markers; 3) Determine how key phenotypic traits vary between reef and mangrove habitats in P. divaricata and P. astreiodes, using a cross-habitat comparative field-study. Results suggest that mangroves may serve as important habitat for some reef corals due to their ability to support a viable, stable, and healthy coral population that is self-sustaining largely through asexual reproduction. Subsequently, mangrove and reef corals display predictable differences in phenotype, that could help reveal how a “reef coral” can exploit darker mangroves. This work can inform the design of marine protected areas, whereby both mangroves as well as the connection between mangroves and reefs is preserved to facilitate coral survival.",U60271725,"SCAVO, KARINA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
96,ROBIN FRANCIS,The effects of variation in habitat quality on reproduction and dispersal of two model systems for coral reef fish metapopulation ecology,"1. A primary objective of marine ecology is to enhance our understanding of the drivers of marine fish population dynamics. These dynamics are readily understood using the framework of metapopulation ecology: for a population to persist, it must be able to self-replicate or be connected to other populations. The drivers of these criteria include rates of reproduction and dispersal, which together determine the rates of recruitment. Recruitment is, however, highly variable, and we do not know widespread patterns and causes of this variation in marine fishes. 2. Reproductive success is notoriously difficult to measure in the wild, and even more so for coral reef fishes that reside underwater. As a proxy, mating success can be predicted from more easily measured determinants, such as variation in individual traits and habitat characteristics. 3. Dispersal has, until recently, been the ‘black box’ of marine ecology, but it can be helpfully described using dispersal kernels. Currently, only five marine fishes have had their dispersal kernel empirically estimated using parentage analyses. From these studies, we see that there are at least four orders of magnitude variation in individual dispersal distances within a species. 4. Many coral reef fishes live in close association with macroinvertebrate hosts, which provide nesting sites and protection from predators. The fish themselves exhibit parental care over clutches of eggs, which hatch into dispersive larvae and recruit back into a suitable host. This life-history suggests habitat quality variation at the scale of the individual host may play a large role in determining relative reproductive and dispersal rates. To explore the role of variation in habitat quality on marine fish reproductive ecology and dispersal ecology, I perform the following three studies: 5. First, I investigate the determinants of variation in mating success in the sponge-dwelling goby, Elacatinus lori. While this fish was the first to have its larval dispersal kernel empirically measured, there were outstanding questions about its reproductive ecology. I describe the characteristics of its breeding habitat, its genetic mating system, and the correlates of male mating success. I show that sponges occupied by breeding males tend to be larger than other sponges, males exhibit a polygynous mating system, and male size, but not sponge size, is positively related to multiple metrics of male mating success. 6. Second, I test for the possibility of plasticity in larval dispersal phenotypes in response to parental habitat quality variation in the orange anemonefish, Amphiprion percula. To pursue this hypothesis, we must first establish that the conditions for parental effects to evolve are met in this system. An initial condition is whether parents can predict the habitat quality that their offspring will encounter. I test for spatial predictability of habitat quality by describing the strength and scale of spatial autocorrelation of three habitat quality indicators: anemone size, female size, and clutch size. I show that all three habitat quality indicators are positively correlated at the scale of an individual patch reef, suggesting that selection might favor parents that increase allocation to offspring that stay within the natal reef if they are in good habitat and increase allocation to offspring that travel farther and leave if they are in poor habitat. Results from this study motivate further investigation of dispersal plasticity in A. percula. 7. Third, I experimentally test the hypothesis that parents can adjust the dispersal-related traits of their offspring in response to changes in habitat quality using a lab population of Amphiprion percula. I describe changes in body size and swimming ability of offspring in response to parental habitat quality by manipulating the parents’ food rations. I find plasticity of larval body size, with parents producing larger offspring when on a low food ration than when on a high food ration. Results from this study motivate future studies to investigate plasticity of larval dispersal distances in the field. 8. In sum, I investigate how variation in habitat quality influences reproductive success, how variation in habitat quality is spatially predictable, and how variation in habitat quality influences dispersal-related traits in two important model systems in marine metapopulation ecology. The work advances our understanding of the role of habitat in determining these vital rates and population dynamics with implications for conservation and fisheries management.",U39468037,"FRANCIS, ROBIN",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
97,HANNAH ELISE AICHELMAN,Exploring coral symbiosis under climate change stress across spatial and temporal scales,"Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased global greenhouse gas concentrations resulting in rapid climate change, which now threatens terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Tropical coral reefs, along with the biodiversity and communities they support, are particularly threatened by these changes in climate. Corals are a consortium of organisms, with the coral host along with its photosynthetic endosymbiont (Family Symbiodiniaceae) and diverse community of microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) together forming the ‘coral holobiont’. However, the symbiosis between tropical corals and Symbiodiniaceae algae is sensitive to even small changes in temperature and ‘coral bleaching’ events – the loss of symbiosis – are now occurring with increased frequency and severity. These bleaching events can result in coral mortality and loss of entire reefs if stressful conditions do not subside. While research efforts have increased our ability to understand and predict coral bleaching events, fundamental questions remain surrounding how genetic diversity of the coral holobiont and interactions with its environment can drive coral resilience or resistance under climate change. The overarching goal of my dissertation is to understand how various abiotic (i.e., stress duration, spatiotemporal variation on the reef) and biotic (i.e., holobiont diversity, symbiosis) factors determine a coral’s response to environmental change at the level of phenotype and genotype. To achieve this goal, I first tested how environmental history and stress duration modulated the physiological responses of two reef-building corals under combined ocean warming and ocean acidification conditions. I found that one species was more stress-resistant (Siderastrea siderea), but that both duration of stress exposure and environmental history (inshore vs. offshore reef origin) modulated coral physiology. Next, I investigated the importance of holobiont genetic identity and abiotic environment in driving phenotypic responses of S. siderea exposed to a diel temperature variability (DTV) and subsequent heat challenge experiment. I found that while DTV increased coral growth, cryptic host diversity and their unique pairings with algal symbiont strains were the strongest predictors of holobiont physiology and response to heat challenge. Lastly, I leveraged genome-wide gene expression profiling and the facultative symbiosis between the subtropical coral Oculina arbuscula and its symbiont Breviolum psygmophilum to disentangle the independent responses of both partners to heat and cold challenges in and out of symbiosis. I found that O. arbuscula host gene expression was more plastic under temperature challenges relative to B. psygmophilum when in symbiosis, and that symbionts exhibited more gene expression plasticity in culture compared to in symbiosis. Taken together, this dissertation provides valuable insights into the phenotypic and genotypic mechanisms that contribute to coral success in a changing climate.",U38057241,"AICHELMAN, HANNAH ELISE",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
98,HANNAH ELISE AICHELMAN,Exposure duration modulates the response of Caribbean corals to global change stressors,"Global change, including rising temperatures and acidification, threatens corals globally. Although bleaching events reveal fine-scale patterns of resilience, traits enabling persistence under global change remain elusive. We conducted a 95-d controlled-laboratory experiment investigating how duration of exposure to warming (~28, 31°C), acidification (pCO2 ~ 343 [present day], ~663 [end of century], ~3109 [extreme] μatm), and their combination influences physiology of reef-building corals (Siderastrea siderea, Pseudodiploria strigosa) from two reef zones on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. Every 30 d, net calcification rate, host protein and carbohydrate, chlorophyll a, and symbiont density were quantified for the same coral individual to characterize acclimation potential under global change. Coral physiologies of the two species were differentially affected by stressors and exposure duration was found to modulate these responses. Siderastrea siderea exhibited resistance to end of century pCO2 and temperature stress, but calcification was negatively affected by extreme pCO2. However, S. siderea calcification rates remained positive after 95 d of extreme pCO2 conditions, suggesting acclimation. In contrast, P. strigosa was more negatively influenced by elevated temperatures, which reduced most physiological parameters. An exception was nearshore P. strigosa, which maintained calcification rates under elevated temperature, suggesting local adaptation to the warmer environment of their natal reef zone. This work highlights how tracking coral physiology across various exposure durations can capture acclimatory responses to global change stressors.",U38057241,"AICHELMAN, HANNAH ELISE",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Many mathematical models have been developed to describe the choice behavior and response time (RT) distributions of observers performing decision-making tasks. However, relatively few researchers use these models because it demands expertise in various numerical, statistical, and software techniques. NEW METHOD: We present a toolbox — Choices and Response Times in R, or ChaRTr — that provides the user the ability to implement and test a wide variety of decision-making models ranging from classic through to modern versions of the diffusion decision model, to models with urgency signals, or collapsing boundaries. RESULTS: In three different case studies, we demonstrate how ChaRTr can be used to effortlessly discriminate between multiple models of decision-making behavior. We also provide guidance on how to extend the toolbox to incorporate future developments in decision-making models. Comparison with existing method(s) Existing software packages surmounted some of the numerical issues but have often focused on the classical decision-making model, the diffusion decision model. Recent models that posit roles for urgency, time-varying decision thresholds, noise in various aspects of the decision-formation process or low pass filtering of sensory evidence have proven to be challenging to incorporate in a coherent software framework that permits quantitative evaluation among these competing classes of decision-making models. CONCLUSION: ChaRTr can be used to make insightful statements about the cognitive processes underlying observed decision-making behavior and ultimately for deeper insights into decision mechanisms.",U99934079,"CHANDRASEKARAN, CHANDRAMOULI",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science.

We performed a large scale study of molecular epidemiology and natural history of SIVagm infection in 225 free-ranging AGMs from multiple locations in South Africa. SIV prevalence (established by sequencing pol, env, and gag) varied dramatically between infant/juvenile (7%) and adult animals (68%) (p,0.0001), and between adult females (78%) and males (57%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extensive genetic diversity, including frequent recombination events. Some AGMs harbored epidemiological linked viruses. Viruses infecting AGMs in the Free State, which are separated from those on the coastal side by the Drakensberg Mountains, formed a separate cluster in the phylogenetic trees; this observation supports a long standing presence of SIV in AGMs, at least from the time of their speciation to their Plio-Pleistocene migration. Specific primers/probes were synthesized based on the pol sequence data and viral loads (VLs) were quantified. VLs were of 104 –106 RNA copies/ml, in the range of those observed in experimentally-infected monkeys, validating the experimental approaches in natural hosts. VLs were significantly higher (107–108 RNA copies/ml) in 10 AGMs diagnosed as acutely infected based on SIV seronegativity (Fiebig II), which suggests a very active transmission of SIVagm in the wild. Neither cytokine levels (as biomarkers of immune activation) nor sCD14 levels (a biomarker of microbial translocation) were different between SIVinfected and SIV-uninfected monkeys. This complex algorithm combining sequencing and phylogeny, VL quantification, serology, and testing of surrogate markers of microbial translocation and immune activation permits a systematic investigation of the epidemiology, viral diversity and natural history of SIV infection in wild African natural hosts.",U02140382,"MA, CHRISTOPHER",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Since the VIIRS first-light images were received in November 2011, NASA- and NOAA-funded scientists have been working to evaluate the instrument performance and generate land and cryosphere products to meet the needs of the NOAA operational users and the NASA science community. NOAA's focus has been on refining a suite of operational products known as Environmental Data Records (EDRs), which were developed according to project specifications under the National Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System. The NASA S-NPP Science Team has focused on evaluating the EDRs for science use, developing and testing additional products to meet science data needs, and providing MODIS data product continuity. This paper presents to-date findings of the NASA Science Team's evaluation of the VIIRS land and cryosphere EDRs, specifically Surface Reflectance, Land Surface Temperature, Surface Albedo, Vegetation Indices, Surface Type, Active Fires, Snow Cover, Ice Surface Temperature, and Sea Ice Characterization.

The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.",U86977904,"MARKS, ERIC",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
106,JIANYU HAN,Ambiguity and information processing in a model of intermediary asset pricing,"This paper incorporates ambiguity and information processing constraints into a model of intermediary asset pricing. Financial intermediaries are assumed to possess greater information processing capacity. Households purchase this capacity, and then delegate their investment decisions to intermediaries. As in He and Krishnamurthy (2012), the delegation contract is constrained by a moral hazard problem, which gives rise to a minimum capital requirement. Both households and intermediaries have a preference for robustness, reflecting ambiguity about asset returns (Hansen and Sargent (2008)). We show that ambiguity aversion tightens the capital constraint, and amplifies its effects. Detection error probabilities are used to discipline the degree of ambiguity aversion. The model can explain both the unconditional moments of asset returns and their state dependence, even with DEPs in excess of 20%.",U04698562,"HAN, JIANYU",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)

We performed a large scale study of molecular epidemiology and natural history of SIVagm infection in 225 free-ranging AGMs from multiple locations in South Africa. SIV prevalence (established by sequencing pol, env, and gag) varied dramatically between infant/juvenile (7%) and adult animals (68%) (p,0.0001), and between adult females (78%) and males (57%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extensive genetic diversity, including frequent recombination events. Some AGMs harbored epidemiological linked viruses. Viruses infecting AGMs in the Free State, which are separated from those on the coastal side by the Drakensberg Mountains, formed a separate cluster in the phylogenetic trees; this observation supports a long standing presence of SIV in AGMs, at least from the time of their speciation to their Plio-Pleistocene migration. Specific primers/probes were synthesized based on the pol sequence data and viral loads (VLs) were quantified. VLs were of 104 –106 RNA copies/ml, in the range of those observed in experimentally-infected monkeys, validating the experimental approaches in natural hosts. VLs were significantly higher (107–108 RNA copies/ml) in 10 AGMs diagnosed as acutely infected based on SIV seronegativity (Fiebig II), which suggests a very active transmission of SIVagm in the wild. Neither cytokine levels (as biomarkers of immune activation) nor sCD14 levels (a biomarker of microbial translocation) were different between SIVinfected and SIV-uninfected monkeys. This complex algorithm combining sequencing and phylogeny, VL quantification, serology, and testing of surrogate markers of microbial translocation and immune activation permits a systematic investigation of the epidemiology, viral diversity and natural history of SIV infection in wild African natural hosts.",U07132205,"SCHMITT, CHRISTOPHER",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
110,CHRISTOPHER SCHMITT,Obesity and obesogenic growth are both highly heritable and modified by diet in a nonhuman primate model the African green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus),"OBJECTIVE: In humans, the ontogeny of obesity throughout the life course and the genetics underlying it has been historically difficult to study. We compared, in a non-human primate model, the lifelong growth trajectories of obese and non-obese adults to assess the heritability of and map potential genomic regions implicated in growth and obesity. STUDY POPULATION: A total of 905 African green monkeys, or vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) (472 females, 433 males) from a pedigreed captive colony. METHODS: We measured fasted body weight (BW), crown-to-rump length (CRL), body-mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) from 2000 to 2015. We used a longitudinal clustering algorithm to detect obesogenic growth, and logistic growth curves implemented in nonlinear mixed effects models to estimate three growth parameters. We used maximum likelihood variance decomposition methods to estimate the genetic contributions to obesity-related traits and growth parameters, including a test for the effects of a calorie-restricted dietary intervention. We used multipoint linkage analysis to map implicated genomic regions. RESULTS: All measurements were significantly influenced by sex, and with the exception of WC, also influenced by maternal and post-natal diet. Chronic obesity outcomes were significantly associated with a pattern of extended growth duration with slow growth rates for BW. After accounting for environmental influences, all measurements were found to have a significant genetic component to variability. Linkage analysis revealed several regions suggested to be linked to obesity-related traits that are also implicated in human obesity and metabolic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: As in humans, growth patterns in vervets have a significant impact on adult obesity and are largely under genetic control with some evidence for maternal and dietary programming. These results largely mirror findings from human research, but reflect shorter developmental periods, suggesting that the vervet offers a strong genetic model for elucidating the ontogeny of human obesity.",U07132205,"SCHMITT, CHRISTOPHER",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
111,JONATHAN BUONOCORE,Evaluation of the Public Health Impacts of Traffic Congestion: A Health Risk Assessment,"BACKGROUND: Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban areas in the United States and around the world. Previous analyses have estimated the economic costs of congestion, related to fuel and time wasted, but few have quantified the public health impacts or determined how these impacts compare in magnitude to the economic costs. Moreover, the relative magnitudes of economic and public health impacts of congestion would be expected to vary significantly across urban areas, as a function of road infrastructure, population density, and atmospheric conditions influencing pollutant formation, but this variability has not been explored. METHODS: In this study, we evaluate the public health impacts of ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations associated with a business-as-usual scenario of predicted traffic congestion. We evaluate 83 individual urban areas using traffic demand models to estimate the degree of congestion in each area from 2000 to 2030. We link traffic volume and speed data with the MOBILE6 model to characterize emissions of PM2.5 and particle precursors attributable to congestion, and we use a source-receptor matrix to evaluate the impact of these emissions on ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Marginal concentration changes are related to a concentration-response function for mortality, with a value of statistical life approach used to monetize the impacts. RESULTS: We estimate that the monetized value of PM2.5-related mortality attributable to congestion in these 83 cities in 2000 was approximately $31 billion (2007 dollars), as compared with a value of time and fuel wasted of $60 billion. In future years, the economic impacts grow (to over $100 billion in 2030) while the public health impacts decrease to $13 billion in 2020 before increasing to $17 billion in 2030, given increasing population and congestion but lower emissions per vehicle. Across cities and years, the public health impacts range from more than an order of magnitude less to in excess of the economic impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that the public health impacts of congestion may be significant enough in magnitude, at least in some urban areas, to be considered in future evaluations of the benefits of policies to mitigate congestion.",U67793350,"BUONOCORE, JONATHAN",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)
112,SARAH DAVIES,Resilience of Atlantic slippersnail Crepidula fornicata larvae in the face of severe coastal acidification,"Globally, average oceanic pH is dropping, and it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future. This ocean acidification (OA) will exacerbate the natural fluctuations in pH that nearshore ecosystems currently experience daily, potentially pushing marine organisms to their physiological limits. Adults of Crepidula fornicata (the Atlantic slippersnail) have proven remarkably resilient to many environmental changes, which is perhaps not surprising considering that they are common intertidally, have a geographically large native range, and have been extremely successful at invading coastal waters in many other parts of the world. However, the larvae of C. fornicata have been shown to be somewhat more vulnerable than adults to the effects of reduced pH. Research to date has focused on the physiological impacts of OA on C. fornicata larvae; few studies have explored shifts in gene expression resulting from changes in pH. In the present study, we examined the response of young (4-day old) C. fornicata larvae to two extreme OA treatments (pH 7.5 and 7.6) relative to pH 8.0, documenting both phenotypic and genome-wide gene expression responses. We found that rearing larvae at reduced pH had subtle influences on gene expression, predominantly involving downregulation of genes related to growth and metabolism, accompanied by significantly reduced shell growth rates only for larvae reared at pH 7.5. Additionally, 10-day old larvae that had been reared at the two lower pH levels were far less likely to metamorphose within 6 h when exposed to inducer. However, all larvae eventually reached similarly high levels of metamorphosis 24 h after settlement induction. Finally, there were no observed impacts of OA on larval mortality. Taken together, our results indicate that far future OA levels have observable, but not severe, impacts on C. fornicata larvae, which is consistent with the resilience of this invasive snail across rapidly changing nearshore ecosystems. We propose that future work should delve further into the physiological and transcriptomic responses of all life history stages to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how OA impacts the littoral gastropod C. fornicata.",U65605891,"DAVIES, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
113,SARAH DAVIES,Varied effects of algal symbionts on transcription factor NF-κB in a sea anemone and a coral: possible roles in symbiosis and thermotolerance,"Many cnidarians, including the reef-building corals, undergo symbiotic mutualisms with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These partnerships are sensitive to temperature extremes, which cause symbiont loss and increased coral mortality. Previous studies have implicated host immunity and specifically immunity transcription factor NF-κB as having a role in the maintenance of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Here we have further investigated a possible role for NF-κB in establishment and loss of symbiosis in various strains of the anemone Exaiptasia (Aiptasia) and in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results show that NF-κB expression is reduced in Aiptasia larvae and adults that host certain algae strains. Treatment of Aiptasia larvae with a known symbiosis-promoting cytokine, transforming growth factor β, also led to decreased NF-κB expression. We also show that aposymbiotic Aiptasia (with high NF-κB expression) have increased survival following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens as compared to symbiotic Aiptasia (low NF-κB expression). Furthermore, a P. damicornis coral colony hosting Durusdinium spp. (formerly clade D) symbionts had higher basal NF-κB expression and decreased heat-induced bleaching as compared to two individuals hosting Cladocopium spp. (formerly clade C) symbionts. Lastly, genome-wide gene expression profiling and genomic promoter analysis identified putative NF-κB target genes that may be involved in thermal bleaching, symbiont maintenance, and/or immune protection in P. damicornis. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis that modulation of NF-κB and immunity plays a role in some, but perhaps not all, cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships as well as in resistance to pathogens and bleaching.",U65605891,"DAVIES, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
114,SARAH DAVIES,Gene expression of endangered coral (Orbicella spp.) in flower garden banks National Marine Sanctuary after Hurricane Harvey,"About 190 km south of the Texas–Louisiana border, the East and West Flower Garden Banks (FGB) have maintained > 50% coral cover with infrequent and minor incidents of disease or bleaching since monitoring began in the 1970s. However, a mortality event, affecting 5.6 ha (2.6% of the area) of the East FGB, occurred in late July 2016 and coincided with storm-generated freshwater runoff extending offshore and over the reef system. To capture the immediate effects of storm-driven freshwater runoff on coral and symbiont physiology, we leveraged the heavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017 by sampling FGB corals at two time points: September 2017, when surface water salinity was reduced (∼34 ppt); and 1 month later when salinity had returned to typical levels (∼36 ppt in October 2017). Tissue samples (N = 47) collected midday were immediately preserved for gene expression profiling from two congeneric coral species (Orbicella faveolata and Orbicella franksi) from the East and West FGB to determine the physiological consequences of storm-derived runoff. In the coral, differences between host species and sampling time points accounted for the majority of differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology enrichment for genes differentially expressed immediately after Hurricane Harvey indicated increases in cellular oxidative stress responses. Although tissue loss was not observed on FGB reefs following Hurricane Harvey, our results suggest that poor water quality following this storm caused FGB corals to experience sub-lethal stress. We also found dramatic expression differences across sampling time points in the coral’s algal symbiont, Breviolum minutum. Some of these differentially expressed genes may be involved in the symbionts’ response to changing environments, including a group of differentially expressed post-transcriptional RNA modification genes. In this study, we cannot disentangle the effects of reduced salinity from the collection time point, so these expression patterns could also be related to seasonality. These findings highlight the urgent need for continued monitoring of these reef systems to establish a baseline for gene expression of healthy corals in the FGB system across seasons, as well as the need for integrated solutions to manage stormwater runoff in the Gulf of Mexico.",U65605891,"DAVIES, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
115,SARAH DAVIES,Exposure to global change and microplastics elicits an immune response in an endangered coral,"Global change is increasing seawater temperatures and decreasing oceanic pH, driving declines of coral reefs globally. Coral ecosystems are also impacted by local stressors, including microplastics, which are ubiquitous on reefs. While the independent effects of these global and local stressors are well-documented, their interactions remain less explored. Here, we examine the independent and combined effects of global change (ocean warming and acidification) and microplastics exposures on gene expression (GE) and microbial community composition in the endangered coral Acropora cervicornis. Nine genotypes were fragmented and maintained in one of four experimental treatments: 1) ambient conditions (ambient seawater, no microplastics; AMB); 2) microplastics treatment (ambient seawater, microplastics; MP); 3) global change conditions (warm and acidic conditions, no microplastics; OAW); and 4) multistressor treatment (warm and acidic conditions with microplastics; OAW+MP) for 22 days, after which corals were sampled for genome-wide GE profiling and ITS2 and 16S metabarcoding. Overall A. cervicornis GE responses to all treatments were subtle; however, corals in the multistressor treatment exhibited the strongest GE responses, and genes associated with innate immunity were overrepresented in this treatment. ITS2 analyses confirmed that all coral were associated with Symbiodinium ‘fitti’ and 16S analyses revealed similar microbiomes dominated by the bacterial associate Aquarickettsia, suggesting that these A. cervicornis fragments exhibited remarkably low variability in algal and bacterial community compositions. Future work should focus on functional differences across microbiomes, especially Aquarickettsia and viruses, in these responses. Overall, results suggest that when local stressors are coupled with global change, these interacting stressors present unique challenges to this endangered coral species.",U65605891,"DAVIES, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
116,SARAH DAVIES,Exposure duration modulates the response of Caribbean corals to global change stressors,"Global change, including rising temperatures and acidification, threatens corals globally. Although bleaching events reveal fine-scale patterns of resilience, traits enabling persistence under global change remain elusive. We conducted a 95-d controlled-laboratory experiment investigating how duration of exposure to warming (~28, 31°C), acidification (pCO2 ~ 343 [present day], ~663 [end of century], ~3109 [extreme] μatm), and their combination influences physiology of reef-building corals (Siderastrea siderea, Pseudodiploria strigosa) from two reef zones on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. Every 30 d, net calcification rate, host protein and carbohydrate, chlorophyll a, and symbiont density were quantified for the same coral individual to characterize acclimation potential under global change. Coral physiologies of the two species were differentially affected by stressors and exposure duration was found to modulate these responses. Siderastrea siderea exhibited resistance to end of century pCO2 and temperature stress, but calcification was negatively affected by extreme pCO2. However, S. siderea calcification rates remained positive after 95 d of extreme pCO2 conditions, suggesting acclimation. In contrast, P. strigosa was more negatively influenced by elevated temperatures, which reduced most physiological parameters. An exception was nearshore P. strigosa, which maintained calcification rates under elevated temperature, suggesting local adaptation to the warmer environment of their natal reef zone. This work highlights how tracking coral physiology across various exposure durations can capture acclimatory responses to global change stressors.",U65605891,"DAVIES, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of our study was to explore whether agricultural activity amongst a peri-urban population in Nepal was associated with better or worse food household security, household and maternal dietary diversity, and nutritional outcomes for children and women. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey administered to 344 mother-child pairs in Bhaktapur district, Nepal, including data on household agricultural practices, livestock ownership, food security, dietary diversity and expenditures, anthropometric measurements of children (aged 5–6 years old), maternal body mass index (BMI), and maternal anemia. Multivariable adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios (AOR and OR respectively) were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that in this sample, cultivation of land was associated with a lower odds of child stunting (AOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33,0.93) and household food insecurity (AOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18, 0.63), but not low (or high) maternal BMI or anemia. Livestock ownership (mostly chickens) was associated with lower of food insecurity (AOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16, 0.73) but not with nutrition outcomes. Women in farming households were significantly more likely to eat green leafy vegetables than women in non-farming households, and children living in households that grew vegetables had a lower odds of stunting than children in households that cultivated land but did not grow vegetables (AOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that households involved in cultivation of land in peri-urban Bhaktapur had lower odds of children's stunting and of food insecurity than non-cultivating households – and that vegetable consumption is higher among those households. Given Nepal's rapid urbanization rate, more attention is needed to the potential role of peri-urban agriculture in shaping diets and nutrition.",U52241673,"LOCKS, LINDSEY",SARGENT COLLEGE OF HEALTH & REHAB.

For this newly emerging task, satellite imagery such as WorldView-2 panchromatic images (WPIs) is used as a potential solution for co-prediction of tree-level multifarious SSVs, with static terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) assumed as a ‘bridge’. The specific operation is to pursue the allometric relationships between TLS-derived SSVs and WPI-derived feature parameters, and regression analyses with one or multiple explanatory variables are applied to deduce the prediction models (termed as Model1s and Model2s). In the case of Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Populus tremul and Quercus robur in a boreal forest, tests showed that Model1s and Model2s for different tree species can be derived (e.g. the maximum R2 = 0.574 for Q. robur). Overall, this study basically validated the algorithm proposed for co-prediction of multifarious SSVs, and the contribution is equivalent to developing a viable solution for SSV-estimation upscaling, which is useful for large-scale investigations of forest understory, macroecosystem ecology, global vegetation dynamics and global carbon cycle.",U50345805,"TIAN, LEI",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

Here, we clarify structural-functional relationships among microorganisms and their mineralogical environment, revealing previously undescribed metabolic activity patterns and precise spatial arrangements within salt marsh sediment. Following 3.7-day in situ incubations with a non-canonical amino acid that was incorporated into new biomass, samples were resin-embedded and analysed by correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy to map the microscale arrangements of anabolically active and inactive organisms alongside mineral grains. Parallel sediment samples were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to link anabolic activity to taxonomic identity. Both approaches demonstrated a rapid decline in the proportion of anabolically active cells with depth into salt marsh sediment, from ~60% in the top centimetre to 9.4%-22.4% between 2 and 10 cm. From the top to the bottom, the most prominent active community members shifted from sulfur cycling phototrophic consortia, to putative sulfate-reducing bacteria likely oxidizing organic compounds, to fermentative lineages. Correlative microscopy revealed more abundant (and more anabolically active) organisms around non-quartz minerals including rutile, orthoclase and plagioclase.

They are exposed to large quantities of both natural and anthropogenic carbon input, and their diverse sediment-hosted microbial communities play key roles in carbon cycling and remineralization. To better understand the effects of natural and anthropogenic carbon on sediment microbial ecology, several sediment cores were collected from Little Sippewissett Salt Marsh (LSSM) on Cape Cod, MA, USA and incubated with either Spartina alterniflora cordgrass or diesel fuel. Resulting shifts in microbial diversity and activity were assessed via bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Both Spartina and diesel amendments resulted in initial decreases of microbial diversity as well as clear, community-wide shifts in metabolic activity. Multi-stage degradative frameworks shaped by fermentation were inferred based on anabolically active lineages. In particular, the metabolically versatile Marinifilaceae were prominent under both treatments, as were the sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrionaceae, which may be attributable to their ability to utilize diverse forms of carbon under nutrient limited conditions. By identifying lineages most directly involved in the early stages of carbon processing, we offer potential targets for indicator species to assess ecosystem health and highlight key players for selective promotion of bioremediation or carbon sequestration pathways.",U49630774,"MARLOW, JEFFREY",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

124,JESSICA TAYLOR,"Caribbean Corals in Crisis: Record Thermal Stress, Bleaching, and Mortality in 2005","BACKGROUND. The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity.

We accomplish this by producing top-down estimates of NOx emissions from inverse modeling of satellite NO2 columns over 1996–2014, and including these emissions in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to simulate chemistry, transport, and deposition of NOy. Our estimates of long-term mean wet nitrate (NO3−) deposition are highly consistent with available measurements in North America, Europe, and East Asia combined (r = 0.83, normalized mean bias  = −7%, N = 136). Likewise, our calculated trends in wet NO3− deposition are largely consistent with the measurements, with 129 of the 136 gridded model–data pairs sharing overlapping 95% confidence intervals. We find that global mean NOy deposition over 1996–2014 is 56.0TgNyr−1, with a minimum in 2006 of 50.5TgN and a maximum in 2012 of 60.8TgN. Regional trends are large, with opposing signs in different parts of the world. Over 1996 to 2014, NOy deposition decreased by up to 60% in eastern North America, doubled in regions of East Asia, and declined by 20% in parts of western Europe. About 40% of the global NOy deposition occurs over oceans, with deposition to the North Atlantic Ocean declining and deposition to the northwestern Pacific Ocean increasing. Using the residual between NOx emissions and NOy deposition over specific land regions, we investigate how NOx export via atmospheric transport has changed over the last 2 decades. Net export from the continental United States decreased substantially, from 2.9TgNyr−1 in 1996 to 1.5TgNyr−1 in 2014. Export from China more than tripled between 1996 and 2011 (from 1.0 to 3.5TgNyr−1), before a striking decline to 2.5TgNyr−1 by 2014. We find that declines in NOx export from some western European countries have counteracted increases in emissions from neighboring countries to the east. A sensitivity study indicates that simulated NOy deposition is robust to uncertainties in NH3 emissions with a few exceptions. Our novel long-term study provides timely context on the rapid redistribution of atmospheric nitrogen transport and subsequent deposition to ecosystems around the world.",U35557852,"GEDDES, JEFFREY",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

(Submitted, 2021)","We present an analysis of sea breeze conditions for the Boston region, and examine their impact on the concentration of local air pollutants over the past decade. Sea breezes occur about one third of the days during the summer, and play an important role in the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of NO2 and O3 across the urban area. Mornings preceding a sea breeze are characterized by low horizontal wind speeds, low background O3, and an accumulation of local primary emissions. Air pollution is recirculated inland during sea breezes, frequently coinciding with the highest O3 measured at the urban center. We use “Ox” (= NO2 + O3) to account for temporary O3 suppression by NO, and find large horizontal gradients (differences in Ox greater than 30 ppb across less than 15 km), which are not observed on otherwise westerly- or easterly-prevailing days. This implies a challenge in surface monitoring networks to adequately represent the spatial variability of secondary air pollution in coastal urban areas. We investigate satellite-based climatologies of tropospheric NO2, and find evidence of selection biases due to cloud conditions, but show that sea breeze days are well observed due to the fair weather conditions generally associated with these events.

129,JEFFREY GEDDES,Coupling between surface ozone and leaf area index in a chemical transport model: strength of feedback and implications for ozone air quality and vegetation health,"Tropospheric ozone is an air pollutant that substantially harms vegetation and is also strongly dependent on various vegetation-mediated processes. The interdependence between ozone and vegetation may constitute feedback mechanisms that can alter ozone concentration itself but have not been considered in most studies to date. In this study we examine the importance of dynamic coupling between surface ozone and leaf area index (LAI) in shaping ozone air quality and vegetation. We first implement an empirical scheme for ozone damage on vegetation in the Community Land Model (CLM) and simulate the steady-state responses of LAI to long-term exposure to a range of prescribed ozone levels (from 0 to 100 ppb). We find that most plant functional types suffer a substantial decline in LAI as ozone level increases. Based on the CLM-simulated results, we develop and implement in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model a parameterization that computes fractional changes in monthly LAI as a function of local mean ozone levels. By forcing LAI to respond to ozone concentrations on a monthly timescale, the model simulates ozone–LAI coupling dynamically via biogeochemical processes including biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and dry deposition, without the complication from meteorological changes. We find that ozone-induced damage on LAI can lead to changes in ozone concentrations by −1.8 to +3 ppb in boreal summer, with a corresponding ozone feedback factor of −0.1 to +0.6 that represents an overall self-amplifying effect from ozone–LAI coupling. Substantially higher simulated ozone due to strong positive feedbacks is found in most tropical forests, mainly due to the ozone-induced reductions in LAI and dry deposition velocity, whereas reduced isoprene emission plays a lesser role in these low-NOx environments. In high-NOx regions such as the eastern US, Europe, and China, however, the feedback effect is much weaker and even negative in some regions, reflecting the compensating effects of reduced dry deposition and reduced isoprene emission (which reduces ozone in high-NOx environments). In remote, low-LAI regions, including most of the Southern Hemisphere, the ozone feedback is generally slightly negative due to the reduced transport of NOx–VOC reaction products that serve as NOx reservoirs. This study represents the first step to accounting for dynamic ozone–vegetation coupling in a chemical transport model with ramifications for a more realistic joint assessment of ozone air quality and ecosystem health.",U35557852,"GEDDES, JEFFREY",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

We derive tropospheric NO2 estimates from the total column with a measurement-model fusion approach using near-real-time estimates of stratospheric NO2 from NASA’s GEOS-CF model system and find the average influence of stratospheric NO2 at this urban site can be 30-70% depending on season and time of day. Sea breeze days tend to exhibit rapid temporal variability in the column that which can go in the opposite direction of changes in surface NO2 concentrations. By comparing tropospheric NO2 with surface concentrations, we constrain the role of boundary layer entrainment processes in the evolution of surface NO2 concentrations, while highlighting the value of column measurements in identifying sea breeze frontal dynamics. We estimate an apparent equal mixing layer height of NO2 and infer that surface NOx emissions remain concentrated near the surface regardless of atmospheric stability regime. When comparing the Pandora- to TROPOMI-derived column NO2 measurements, we find that sea breeze days present a unique challenge likely due to higher spatial heterogeneity in NO2 and the meteorology involved that is not well represented in operational retrieval inputs. Our observations provide new insights into column and surface variability of NO2 which will be relevant to interpreting geostationary observations, especially in coastal urban locations.",U35557852,"GEDDES, JEFFREY",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

134,JEFFREY GEDDES,Relationships between changes in urban characteristics and air quality in East Asia from 2000 to 2010,"Characteristics of urban areas, such as density and compactness, are associated with local air pollution concentrations. The potential for altering air pollution through changing urban characteristics, however, is less certain, especially for expanding cities within the developing world. We examined changes in urban characteristics from 2000 to 2010 for 830 cities in East Asia to evaluate associations with changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. Urban areas were stratified by population size into small (100 000-250 000), medium, (250 000-1 000 000), and large (>1 000 000). Multivariate regression models including urban baseline characteristics, meteorological variables, and change in urban characteristics explained 37%, 49%, and 54% of the change in NO2 and 29%, 34%, and 37% of the change in PM2.5 for small, medium and large cities, respectively. Change in lights at night strongly predicted change in NO2 and PM2.5, while urban area expansion was strongly associated with NO2 but not PM2.5. Important differences between changes in urban characteristics and pollutant levels were observed by city size, especially NO2. Overall, changes in urban characteristics had a greater impact on NO2 and PM2.5 change than baseline characteristics, suggesting urban design and land use policies can have substantial impacts on local air pollution levels.",U35557852,"GEDDES, JEFFREY",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

From 21 September−2 November 2015, the HTP discharged ~39 × 103 m3 h−1 of treated wastewater into Santa Monica Bay through their emergency 1-mile outfall pipe. Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing was employed to determine the biophysical impact of discharged wastewater in the shallow nearshore environment. Landsat 8 TIRS observed decreased sea surface temperatures (SST) associated with the surfacing wastewater plume. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Aqua MODIS satellite sensors were used to monitor the biological response to the addition of nutrient-rich wastewater. In situ chl-a and in situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were measured before, during, and after the diversion event. These in situ data were paired with coincident OLI and MODIS satellite data to yield a more comprehensive view of the changing conditions in Santa Monica Bay due to the wastewater diversion. Two new local chl-a algorithms were empirically derived using in situ data for the OLI and MODIS sensors. These new local chl-a algorithms proved more accurate at measuring chl-a changes in Santa Monica Bay compared to the standard open ocean OC2 and OC3M algorithms, and the regional southern California CALFIT algorithm, as validated by in situ chl-a measurements. Additionally, the local OLI algorithm outperformed the local MODIS algorithm, especially in the nearshore region. A time series of chl-a, as detected by the local OLI chl-a algorithm, illustrated a very large increase in chl-a concentrations during the wastewater diversion, and a subsequent decrease in chl-a after the diversion. Our study demonstrates the capability of using Landsat 8 TIRS and OLI sensors for the monitoring of SST and surface chl-a concentrations at high spatial resolution in nearshore waters and highlights the value of these sensors for assessing the environmental effects of wastewater discharge in a coastal environment.",U33559483,"FICHOT, CEDRIC",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
136,JUDITH SCOTT,"Caribbean Corals in Crisis: Record Thermal Stress, Bleaching, and Mortality in 2005","BACKGROUND. The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.",U32642896,"SCOTT, JUDITH",SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK (SSW)

138,TREVOR SIGGERS,Varied effects of algal symbionts on transcription factor NF-κB in a sea anemone and a coral: possible roles in symbiosis and thermotolerance,"Many cnidarians, including the reef-building corals, undergo symbiotic mutualisms with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These partnerships are sensitive to temperature extremes, which cause symbiont loss and increased coral mortality. Previous studies have implicated host immunity and specifically immunity transcription factor NF-κB as having a role in the maintenance of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Here we have further investigated a possible role for NF-κB in establishment and loss of symbiosis in various strains of the anemone Exaiptasia (Aiptasia) and in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results show that NF-κB expression is reduced in Aiptasia larvae and adults that host certain algae strains. Treatment of Aiptasia larvae with a known symbiosis-promoting cytokine, transforming growth factor β, also led to decreased NF-κB expression. We also show that aposymbiotic Aiptasia (with high NF-κB expression) have increased survival following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens as compared to symbiotic Aiptasia (low NF-κB expression). Furthermore, a P. damicornis coral colony hosting Durusdinium spp. (formerly clade D) symbionts had higher basal NF-κB expression and decreased heat-induced bleaching as compared to two individuals hosting Cladocopium spp. (formerly clade C) symbionts. Lastly, genome-wide gene expression profiling and genomic promoter analysis identified putative NF-κB target genes that may be involved in thermal bleaching, symbiont maintenance, and/or immune protection in P. damicornis. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis that modulation of NF-κB and immunity plays a role in some, but perhaps not all, cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships as well as in resistance to pathogens and bleaching.",U92246557,"SIGGERS, TREVOR",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
139,ANDREW KURTZ,Soil warming accelerates biogeochemical silica cycling in a temperate forest,"Biological cycling of silica plays an important role in terrestrial primary production. Soil warming stemming from climate change can alter the cycling of elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, in forested ecosystems. However, the effects of soil warming on the biogeochemical cycle of silica in forested ecosystems remain unexplored. Here we examine long-term forest silica cycling under ambient and warmed conditions over a 15-year period of experimental soil warming at Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA). Specifically, we measured silica concentrations in organic and mineral soils, and in the foliage and litter of two dominant species (Acer rubrum and Quercus rubra), in a large (30 × 30 m) heated plot and an adjacent control plot (30 × 30 m). In 2016, we also examined effects of heating on dissolved silica in the soil solution, and conducted a litter decomposition experiment using four tree species (Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra, Betula lenta, Tsuga canadensis) to examine effects of warming on the release of biogenic silica (BSi) from plants to soils. We find that tree foliage maintained constant silica concentrations in the control and warmed plots, which, coupled with productivity enhancements under warming, led to an increase in total plant silica uptake. We also find that warming drove an acceleration in the release of silica from decaying litter in three of the four species we examined, and a substantial increase in the silica dissolved in soil solution. However, we observe no changes in soil BSi stocks with warming. Together, our data indicate that warming increases the magnitude of silica uptake by vegetation and accelerates the internal cycling of silica in in temperate forests, with possible, and yet unresolved, effects on the delivery of silica from terrestrial to marine systems.",U91103754,"KURTZ, ANDREW",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
140,JOHN R FINNERTY,Intraspecific variation in oxidative stress tolerance in a model cnidarian: differences in peroxide sensitivity between and within populations of Nematostella vectensis,"Nematostella vectensis is a member of the phylum Cnidaria, a lineage that includes anemones, corals, hydras, and jellyfishes. This estuarine anemone is an excellent model system for investigating the evolution of stress tolerance because it is easy to collect in its natural habitat and to culture in the laboratory, and it has a sequenced genome. Additionally, there is evidence of local adaptation to environmental stress in different N. vectensis populations, and abundant protein-coding polymorphisms have been identified, including polymorphisms in proteins that are implicated in stress responses. N. vectensis can tolerate a wide range of environmental parameters, and has recently been shown to have substantial intraspecific variation in temperature preference. We investigated whether different clonal lines of anemones also exhibit differential tolerance to oxidative stress. N. vectensis populations are continually exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during cellular metabolism and by other environmental factors. Fifteen clonal lines of N. vectensis collected from four different estuaries were exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Pronounced differences in survival and regeneration were apparent between clonal lines collected from Meadowlands, NJ, Baruch, SC, and Kingsport, NS, as well as among 12 clonal lines collected from a single Cape Cod marsh. To our knowledge, this is the first example of intraspecific variability in oxidative stress resistance in cnidarians or in any marine animal. As oxidative stress often accompanies heat stress in marine organisms, resistance to oxidative stress could strongly influence survival in warming oceans. For example, while elevated temperatures trigger bleaching in corals, oxidative stress is thought to be the proximal trigger of bleaching at the cellular level.",U89903759,"FINNERTY, JOHN R",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

The influence trees have on urban climates via shading is driven by the morphological characteristics of trees, whereas tree transpiration is predominantly a physiological process dependent on environmental conditions and the built environment. The heterogeneous nature of urban landscapes, unique tree species assemblages, and land management decisions make it difficult to predict the magnitude and direction of cooling by transpiration. In the present article, we synthesize the emerging literature on the mechanistic controls on urban tree transpiration. We present a case study that illustrates the relationship between transpiration (using sap flow data) and urban temperatures. We examine the potential feed backs among urban canopy, the built environment, and climate with a focus on extreme heat events.

While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science.

147,MICHAEL SMITH,Long‐term observations and physical processes in the Moon's extended sodium tail,"The lunar surface is constantly bombarded by the solar wind, photons, and meteoroids, which can liberate Na atoms from the regolith. These atoms are subsequently accelerated by solar photon pressure to form a long comet-like tail opposite the sun. Near new moon, these atoms encounter the Earth's gravity and are “focused” into a beam of enhanced density. This beam appears as the ∼3° diameter Sodium Moon Spot (SMS). Data from the all sky imager at the El Leoncito Observatory have been analyzed for changes in the SMS shape and brightness. New geometry-based relationships have been found that affect the SMS brightness. The SMS is brighter when the Moon is north of the ecliptic at new moon; the SMS is brighter when new moon occurs near perigee; and the SMS peaks in brightness ∼5 h after new moon. After removing these effects, the data were analyzed for long term and seasonal patterns that could be attributed to changes in source mechanisms. No correlation was found between the SMS brightness and the 11-year solar-cycle, the proton or the He++ flow pressure, the density, the speed or the plasma temperature of the solar wind, but an annual pattern was found. A ∼0.83 correlation (Pearson's “r”) was found between the SMS brightness and a 4-year average of sporadic meteor rates at Earth, suggesting a cause-and-effect. The new insights gained from this long-term study put new constraints on the variability of the potential sources of the Na atoms escaping from the Moon.",U73440075,"SMITH, MICHAEL",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)
148,SARAH PHILLIPS,Varied effects of algal symbionts on transcription factor NF-κB in a sea anemone and a coral: possible roles in symbiosis and thermotolerance,"Many cnidarians, including the reef-building corals, undergo symbiotic mutualisms with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These partnerships are sensitive to temperature extremes, which cause symbiont loss and increased coral mortality. Previous studies have implicated host immunity and specifically immunity transcription factor NF-κB as having a role in the maintenance of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Here we have further investigated a possible role for NF-κB in establishment and loss of symbiosis in various strains of the anemone Exaiptasia (Aiptasia) and in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results show that NF-κB expression is reduced in Aiptasia larvae and adults that host certain algae strains. Treatment of Aiptasia larvae with a known symbiosis-promoting cytokine, transforming growth factor β, also led to decreased NF-κB expression. We also show that aposymbiotic Aiptasia (with high NF-κB expression) have increased survival following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens as compared to symbiotic Aiptasia (low NF-κB expression). Furthermore, a P. damicornis coral colony hosting Durusdinium spp. (formerly clade D) symbionts had higher basal NF-κB expression and decreased heat-induced bleaching as compared to two individuals hosting Cladocopium spp. (formerly clade C) symbionts. Lastly, genome-wide gene expression profiling and genomic promoter analysis identified putative NF-κB target genes that may be involved in thermal bleaching, symbiont maintenance, and/or immune protection in P. damicornis. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis that modulation of NF-κB and immunity plays a role in some, but perhaps not all, cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships as well as in resistance to pathogens and bleaching.",U65305425,"PHILLIPS, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

150,DANIEL P MILLER,Food insecurity in veteran households: findings from nationally representative data,"OBJECTIVE: The present study is the first to use nationally representative data to compare rates of food insecurity among households with veterans of the US Armed Forces and non-veteran households. DESIGN: We used data from the 2005-2013 waves of the Current Population Survey - Food Security Supplement to identify rates of food insecurity and very low food security in veteran and non-veteran households. We estimated the odds and probability of food insecurity in veteran and non-veteran households in uncontrolled and controlled models. We replicated these results after separating veteran households by their most recent period of service. We weighted models to create nationally representative estimates. SETTING: Nationally representative data from the 2005-2013 waves of the Current Population Survey - Food Security Supplement. SUBJECTS: US households (n 388 680). RESULTS: Uncontrolled models found much lower rates of food insecurity (8·4 %) and very low food security (3·3 %) among veteran households than in non-veteran households (14·4 % and 5·4 %, respectively), with particularly low rates among households with older veterans. After adjustment, average rates of food insecurity and very low food security were not significantly different for veteran households. However, the probability of food insecurity was significantly higher among some recent veterans and significantly lower for those who served during the Vietnam War. CONCLUSIONS: Although adjusting eliminated many differences between veteran and non-veteran households, veterans who served from 1975 and onwards may be at higher risk for food insecurity and should be the recipients of targeted outreach to improve nutritional outcomes.",U64105789,"MILLER, DANIEL P",SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK (SSW)

152,CYNTHIA A. BRADHAM,Ethanol exposure perturbs sea urchin development and disrupts developmental timing,"Ethanol is a known vertebrate teratogen that causes craniofacial defects as a component of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Our results show that sea urchin embryos treated with ethanol similarly show broad skeletal patterning defects, potentially analogous to the defects associated with FAS. The sea urchin larval skeleton is a simple patterning system that involves only two cell types: the primary mesenchymal cells (PMCs) that secrete the calcium carbonate skeleton and the ectodermal cells that provide migratory, positional, and differentiation cues for the PMCs. Perturbations in RA biosynthesis and Hh signaling pathways are thought to be causal for the FAS phenotype in vertebrates. Surprisingly, our results indicate that these pathways are not functionally relevant for the teratogenic effects of ethanol in developing sea urchins. We found that developmental morphology as well as the expression of ectodermal and PMC genes was delayed by ethanol exposure. Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed significant impacts of ethanol on signaling and metabolic gene expression, and a disruption in the timing of GRN gene expression that includes both delayed and precocious gene expression throughout the specification network. We conclude that the skeletal patterning perturbations in ethanol-treated embryos likely arise from a loss of temporal synchrony within and between the instructive and responsive tissues.",U63972355,"BRADHAM, CYNTHIA A.",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Previous studies have examined wet bulb globe temperatures and estimated metabolic rates to assess heat stress, but there are limited data characterizing heat strain among these workers. OBJECTIVE: The aims were to characterize heat stress and heat strain and examine whether job task, break duration, hydration practices, and kidney function were associated with heat strain. METHODS: We used data from the MesoAmerican Nephropathy Occupational Study, a cohort of 569 outdoor workers in El Salvador and Nicaragua who underwent workplace exposure monitoring, including continuous measurement of core body temperature (Tc), heart rate (HR), physical activity, and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), over the course of three days in January 2018 - May 2018. Participants represented five industries: sugarcane, corn, plantain, brickmaking, and construction. RESULTS: Median WBGTs were relatively high (>27 °C) at most sites, particularly when work shifts spanned the afternoon hours (e.g., 29.2 °C among plantain workers). Sugarcane workers, especially cane cutters in both countries and Nicaraguan agrichemical applicators, had the highest estimated metabolic rates (medians: 299-318 kcal/hr). Most workers spent little time on break (<10% of the shift), as determined by physical activity data. Overall, sugarcane workers-particularly those in Nicaragua-experienced the highest Tc and HR values. However, a few workers in other industries reached high Tc (>39 °C) as well. Impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) was associated with higher Tc and HR values, even after adjustment. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the largest study to-date examining heat stress and strain among outdoor workers in Central America. Workers at sugar companies regularly experienced Tc > 38°C (76.9% of monitored person-days at Nicaraguan companies; 46.5% at Salvadoran companies). Workers with impaired kidney function had higher measures of Tc and HR. IMPACT STATEMENT: This study examined levels of occupational heat stress and heat strain experienced among outdoor workers in five industries in El Salvador and Nicaragua. We characterized heat stress using wet bulb globe temperatures and estimated metabolic rate and heat strain using core body temperature and heart rate. Sugarcane workers, particularly cane cutters and Nicaraguan agrichemical applicators, performed more strenuous work and experienced greater levels of heat strain.

Findings indicated that youth councils were engaged in a wide-range of activities suggesting the model is fluid to meet the needs of both the youth and the community. Specific impacts were identified by participants some of which were directly related to the delivery of activities and others which influenced policy change. Among the barriers identified was the continuing need to identify a broader range of youth to participate in these initiatives.

BUSTON,Offspring sex preferences among patrilineal and matrilineal Mosuo in Southwest China revealed by differences in parity progression,"Son preference predominates in China, yet there are patterned exceptions to this rule. In this paper, we test whether lineality (patrilineal versus matrilineal inheritance and descent) is associated with son versus daughter preference among the ethnic Mosuo (Na) of Southwest China. Our results show (i) an increased probability of continued fertility among matrilineal women after having a son compared with a daughter and (ii) an increased probability of continued fertility among patrilineal women after having a daughter compared with a son. These results are consistent with son preference among patrilineal Mosuo and more muted daughter preference among the matrilineal Mosuo. Furthermore, we show (iii) the lowest probability of continued fertility at parity 2 once women have one daughter and one son across both systems, suggesting that preferences for at least one of each sex exist alongside preferences for the lineal sex. The Mosuo are the only known small-scale society in which two kinship systems distinguish sub-groups with many otherwise shared cultural characteristics.

BUSTON,Description of surface transport in the region of the Belizean Barrier Reef based on observations and alternative high-resolution models,"The gains from implementing high-resolution versus less costly low-resolution models to describe coastal circulation are not always clear, often lacking statistical evaluation. Here we construct a hierarchy of ocean–atmosphere models operating at multiple scales within a 1 × 1° domain of the Belizean Barrier Reef (BBR). The various components of the atmosphere–ocean models are evaluated with in situ observations of surface drifters, wind and sea surface temperature. First, we compare the dispersion and velocity of 55 surface drifters released in the field in summer 2013 to the dispersion and velocity of simulated drifters under alternative model configurations. Increasing the resolution of the ocean model (from 1/12° to 1/100°, from 1 day to 1 h) and atmosphere model forcing (from 1/2° to 1/100°, from 6 h to 1 h), and incorporating tidal forcing incrementally reduces discrepancy between simulated and observed velocities and dispersion. Next, in trying to understand why the high-resolution models improve prediction, we find that resolving both the diurnal sea-breeze and semi-diurnal tides is key to improving the Lagrangian statistics and transport predictions along the BBR. Notably, the model with the highest ocean–atmosphere resolution and with tidal forcing generates a higher number of looping trajectories and sub-mesoscale coherent structures that are otherwise unresolved. Finally, simulations conducted with this model from June to August of 2013 show an intensification of the velocity fields throughout the summer and reveal a mesoscale anticyclonic circulation around Glovers Reef, and sub-mesoscale cyclonic eddies formed in the vicinity of Columbus Island. This study provides a general framework to assess the best surface transport prediction from alternative ocean–atmosphere models using metrics derived from high frequency drifters’ data and meteorological stations.",U12736038,"BUSTON, PETER M.",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
161,DARREN ROBLYER,Compressive remodeling alters fluid transport properties of collagen networks - implications for tumor growth,"Biomechanical alterations to the tumor microenvironment include accumulation of solid stresses, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening and increased fluid pressure in both interstitial and peri-tumoral spaces. The relationship between interstitial fluid pressurization and ECM remodeling in vascularized tumors is well characterized, while earlier biomechanical changes occurring during avascular tumor growth within the peri-tumoral ECM remain poorly understood. Type I collagen, the primary fibrous ECM constituent, bears load in tension while it buckles under compression. We hypothesized that tumor-generated compressive forces cause collagen remodeling via densification which in turn creates a barrier to convective fluid transport and may play a role in tumor progression and malignancy. To better understand this process, we characterized the structure-function relationship of collagen networks under compression both experimentally and computationally. Here we show that growth of epithelial cancers induces compressive remodeling of the ECM, documented in the literature as a TACS-2 phenotype, which represents a localized densification and tangential alignment of peri-tumoral collagen. Such compressive remodeling is caused by the unique features of collagen network mechanics, such as fiber buckling and cross-link rupture, and reduces the overall hydraulic permeability of the matrix.",U48669818,"ROBLYER, DARREN",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
162,ANDREW BELL,Smart subsidies for sustainable soils: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial in southern Malawi,"Conventional agricultural practices – especially conventional tillage – are a major driver of soil erosion globally. While soil may not frequently considered a vulnerable natural resource, the erosion and degradation of soils poses a serious threat to food production and the production of numerous otherin situ andex situ ecosystem services. This study provides some of the first evidence on the effectiveness of a payments for ecosystem services (PES) program to encourage the adoption of soil conservation practices, specifically conservation agriculture (CA). Through minimized soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and diversified crop mix, CA is believed to enhance soil fertility and rehabilitate soil structure, with the resulting preservation of ecosystem service flows. By providing calibrated financial incentives, we demonstrate that it is possible to substantially increase the extent and intensity of CA adoption. What is more, we show that a novel incentive mechanisms that leverages social networks for the consolidation of fragmented land may be more effective at bringing more land under conservation objectives, even if some of the additional land does not officially fall under the purview of the PES program. We also demonstrate that some of the supposed weaknesses hindering the adoption of CA – lower yields in the short-run and higher expenditures on weed control – were not necessarily obstacles in our study area, perhaps suggesting that the provision of subsidies need not continue into perpetuity, but may only be needed to overcome short-term transition costs.",U38590717,"BELL, ANDREW",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
163,ANDREW BELL,Experimental evidence on the impact of payments and property rights on forest user decisions,"Clearing forests for swidden agriculture, despite providing food to millions of farmers in the tropics, can be a major driver of deforestation. Payments for ecosystem services schemes can help stop swidden agriculture-induced forest loss by rewarding forest users for maintaining forests. Clear and secure property rights are a key prerequisite for the success of these payment schemes. In this study, we use a novel iterative and dynamic game in Madagascar and Kenya to examine farmer responses to individual and communal rights to forestlands, with and without financial incentives, in the context of swidden agricultural landscapes. We find that farmer pro conservation behaviour, defined by the propensity to keep forests or fallows on their lands, as well as the effects of land tenure and conservation incentive treatments on such behaviour, differ across the two contexts. The average percentages of land left forest/fallow in the game are 65 and 35% in Kenya and Madagascar, respectively. Individual ownership significantly improves decisions to preserve forests or leave land fallow in Madagascar but has no significant effect in Kenya. Also, the effect of the individual tenure treatment varies across education and wealth levels in Madagascar. Subsidy increases farmers' willingness to support conservation interests in both countries, but its effect is four times greater in Kenya. We find no interaction effects of the two treatments in either country. We conclude that the effectiveness of financial incentives for conservation and tenure reform in preserving forestland vary significantly across contexts. We show how interactive games can help develop a more targeted and practical approach to environmental policy.",U38590717,"BELL, ANDREW",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
