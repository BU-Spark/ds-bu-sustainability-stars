0,KAREN JACOBSON,Climate change and urban migration in sub-saharan African cities: impacts and governance challenges,"Urban informal settlements are rapidly expanding in countries around the world. This is due partly to high birth rates, but also because of growing in-migration driven by climate change impacts affecting rural populations. Urban informal settlements struggle with degraded and sometimes nonexistent infrastructure (such as water, sewage, and drainage systems) and service provision (health, education), and these shortcomings are aggravated by urban climate-related hazards like flooding and heat spikes. As informal settlements expand, their already overburdened infrastructure can lead to urban disasters such as flooding and landfill collapse. These challenges increase the governance and financial problems already faced by cities and create significant problems for climate resilience planning processes. Policy responses at both the national and city levels promise much but deliver little. This article reviews …",2023,U00279444,"JACOBSON, KAREN",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
1,KAREN JACOBSON,"Urban policy responses to climate hazards in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Urban in-migration, high birth rates and unchecked development are driving the continued growth of African cities. Much of this urbanization occurs in informal settlements, where unplanned growth exacerbates the impacts of climate hazards. Our paper explores the challenges faced by urban planners seeking to address climate change threats in African cities. Focusing on Addis Ababa, we conduct a robust policy analysis of urban government response. Our main finding is that Addis Ababa’s environmental challenges are primarily a result of urban development and inadequate planning and policy enforcement. Environmental challenges are exacerbated by rapidly intensifying climate impacts, but not driven by them. Improved city-level policy responses can potentially mitigate many of Addis Ababa’s current environmental challenges and prepare the city to weather future ones. We highlight four areas of policy …",2024,U00279444,"JACOBSON, KAREN",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
2,JAMES BIRD,Provenance of aerosol black carbon over northeast Indian ocean and South China sea and implications for oceanic black carbon cycling,"Aerosol black carbon (BC) is a short-lived climate pollutant. The poorly constrained provenance of tropical marine aerosol BC hinders the mechanistic understanding of extreme climate events and oceanic carbon cycling. Here, we collected PM2.5 samples during research cruise NORC2016-10 through South China Sea (SCS) and Northeast Indian Ocean (NEIO) and measured the dual-carbon isotope compositions (δ13C–Δ14C) of BC using hydrogen pyrolysis technique. Aerosol BC exhibits six different δ13C−Δ14C isotopic spaces (i.e., isotope provinces). Liquid fossil fuel combustion, from shipping emissions and adjacent land, is the predominant source of BC over isotope provinces “SCS close to Chinese Mainland” (53.5%), “Malacca Strait” (53.4%), and “Open NEIO” (40.7%). C3 biomass burning is the major contributor to BC over isotope provinces “NEIO close to Southeast Asia” (55.8%), “Open NEIO” (41.3 …",2023,U96921436,"BIRD, JAMES",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
3,YUAN SUN,Chex: Channel exploration for cnn model compression,"Channel pruning has been broadly recognized as an effective technique to reduce the computation and memory cost of deep convolutional neural networks. However, conventional pruning methods have limitations in that: they are restricted to pruning process only, and they require a fully pre-trained large model. Such limitations may lead to sub-optimal model quality as well as excessive memory and training cost. In this paper, we propose a novel Channel Exploration methodology, dubbed as CHEX, to rectify these problems. As opposed to pruning-only strategy, we propose to repeatedly prune and regrow the channels throughout the training process, which reduces the risk of pruning important channels prematurely. More exactly: From intra-layer's aspect, we tackle the channel pruning problem via a well-known column subset selection (CSS) formulation. From inter-layer's aspect, our regrowing stages open a path for dynamically re-allocating the number of channels across all the layers under a global channel sparsity constraint. In addition, all the exploration process is done in a single training from scratch without the need of a pre-trained large model. Experimental results demonstrate that CHEX can effectively reduce the FLOPs of diverse CNN architectures on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and 3D vision. For example, our compressed ResNet-50 model on ImageNet dataset achieves 76% top-1 accuracy with only 25% FLOPs of the original ResNet-50 model, outperforming previous state-of-the-art channel pruning methods. The checkpoints and code are available at …",2022,U93745903,"SUN, YUAN",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)
4,KAMAL SEN,Modelling the Predictors of Mobile Health (mHealth) Adoption among Healthcare Professionals in Low-Resource Environments,"This study was conducted with objectives to measure and validate the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model as well as to identify the predictors of mobile health (mHealth) technology adoption among healthcare professionals in limited-resource settings. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the six public and private hospitals in the two districts (Lodhran and Multan) of Punjab, Pakistan. The participants of the study comprised healthcare professionals (registered doctors and nurses) working in the participating hospitals. The findings of the seven-factor measurement model showed that behavioral intention (BI) to mHealth adoption is significantly influenced by performance expectancy (β = 0.504, CR = 5.064, p < 0.05) and self-concept (β = 0.860, CR = 5.968, p < 0.05) about mHealth technologies. The findings of the structural equation model (SEM) showed that the model is acceptable (χ2 (df = 259) = 3.207; p = 0.000; CFI = 0.891, IFI = 0.892, TLI = 0.874, RMSEA = 0.084). This study suggests that the adoption of mHealth can significantly help in improving people’s access to quality healthcare resources and services as well as help in reducing costs and improving healthcare services. This study is significant in terms of identifying the predictors that play a determining role in the adoption of mHealth among healthcare professionals. This study presents an evidence-based model that provides an insight to policymakers, health organizations, governments, and political leaders in terms of facilitating, promoting, and implementing mHealth adoption plans in low-resource settings, which can significantly reduce health …",2023,U90693139,"SEN, KAMAL",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)
5,JOHN R FINNERTY,"Holobiont transcriptomes for the critically endangered staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) from two environmentally distinct sites on Turneffe Atoll, Belize","Historically, staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) was a preeminent reef-builder in the Caribbean and Tropical Western Atlantic, where it constructed extensive thickets at 5-20 m depth that supported diverse ecosystems and provided coastal populations with food, storm protection, and income from tourism. In recent decades, A. cervicornis declined precipitously, up to 97% in some localities. To reverse its decline, widespread efforts are underway to characterize the phenotypic and genetic diversity of persisting populations with the goal of restoring them to historical levels by out-planting nursery grown specimens. To support this target, we developed transcriptomes for two A. cervicornis populations located in Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, Belize. These populations experience significantly different temperatures, light levels and water currents, and they harbor individuals that differ in key phenotypes. Because differentiating the gene activity of diverse taxa—i.e., coral host, algal photosymbiont, plus associated eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and viruses— is critical to understanding the function of the coral holobiont, we developed a pipeline for parsing transcripts by taxon. Separate transcriptomes for each population contain complete representatives for >96% of 978 conserved metazoan single copy orthologs. The taxonomic breakdown of transcripts differed between sites, with more bacterial transcripts recovered from Calabash Caye and more symbiont transcripts from Blackbird Caye. The assembled transcriptomes will facilitate gene expression studies and in silico cloning from this endangered coral.",2022,U89903759,"FINNERTY, JOHN R",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

8,DAVID LAGAKOS,The Welfare Effects of Encouraging Rural–Urban Migration,"This paper studies the welfare effects of encouraging rural–urban migration in the developing world. To do so, we build and analyze a dynamic general‐equilibrium model of migration that features a rich set of migration motives. We estimate the model to replicate the results of a field experiment that subsidized seasonal migration in rural Bangladesh, leading to significant increases in migration and consumption. We show that the welfare gains from migration subsidies come from providing better insurance for vulnerable rural households rather than from correcting spatial misallocation by relaxing credit constraints for those with high productivity in urban areas that are stuck in rural areas.",2023,U86309545,"LAGAKOS, DAVID",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
9,IGOR KRAMNIK,Progression and dissemination of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection in a susceptible immunocompetent mouse model,"Pulmonary infections caused by the group of nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), are a growing public health concern with incidence and mortality steadily increasing globally. Granulomatous inflammation is the hallmark of MAC lung infection, yet reliable correlates of disease progression, susceptibility, and resolution are poorly defined. Unlike widely used inbred mouse strains, mice that carry the mutant allele at the genetic locus sst1 develop human-like pulmonary tuberculosis featuring well-organized caseating granulomas. We characterized pulmonary temporospatial outcomes of intranasal and left intrabronchial M. avium spp. hominissuis (M.av) induced pneumonia in B6.Sst1S mice, which carries the sst1 mutant allele. We utilized traditional semi-quantitative histomorphological evaluation, in combination with fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry (fmIHC), whole slide imaging, and quantitative digital image analysis. Followingintrabronchiolar infection with the laboratory M.av strain 101, the B6.Sst1S pulmonary lesions progressed 12–16 weeks post infection (wpi), with plateauing and/or resolving disease by 21 wpi. Caseating granulomas were not observed during the study. Disease progression from 12–16 wpi was associated with increased acid-fast bacilli, area of secondary granulomatous pneumonia lesions, and Arg1+ and double positive iNOS+/Arg1+ macrophages. Compared to B6 WT, at 16 wpi, B6.Sst1S lungs exhibited an increased area of acid-fast bacilli, larger secondary lesions with greater Arg1+ and double positive iNOS+/Arg1+ macrophages, and reduced T cell density.

10,BRIAN MICHAEL WALSH,Quantifying the global solar wind-magnetosphere interaction with the Solar-Terrestrial Observer for the Response of the Magnetosphere (STORM) mission concept,"Much of what we know about the solar wind’s interaction with the Earth’s magnetosphere has been gained from isolated in-situ measurements by single or multiple spacecraft. Based on their observations, we know that reconnection, whether on the dayside magnetopause or deep within the Earth’s magnetotail, controls the bulk flow of solar wind energy into and through the global system and that nightside activity provides the energized particles that power geomagnetic storms. But by their very nature these isolated in-situ measurements cannot provide an instantaneous global view of the entire system or its cross-scale dynamics. To fully quantify the dynamics of the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere requires comprehensive end-to-end global imaging of the key plasma structures that comprise the magnetosphere which have spatial resolutions that exceeds anything possible with multi-point or constellation situ measurements. Global, end-to-end, imaging provides the pathway to understanding the system as a whole, its constituent parts, and its cross-scale processes on a continuous basis, as needed to quantify the flow of solar wind energy through the global magnetospheric system. This paper describes how a comprehensively-instrumented single spacecraft in a high-altitude, high-inclination orbit coupled with ground-based instruments provides the essential observations needed to track and quantify the flow of solar wind energy through the magnetosphere. This includes observations of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field input, the magnetopause location in soft X-rays, the auroral oval in far ultraviolet, the ring current in energetic …",2023,U84229410,"WALSH, BRIAN MICHAEL",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

The"" state of the art"" tool to propagate measurements from L1 (roughly 200 RE upstream) to Earth is the planar propagation method. This method, along with instrument cross calibration, is used to construct the OMNI database.

In this study, a numerical model is presented to track the nucleation and growth of lithium dendrites when exposed to varying surface chemistries, in particular changes in surface energies. A combination of density functional theory (DFT) and continuum-level computational fluid dynamics is used to study the effects of surface energy on dendrite nucleation and growth. For a series of defects and concentrations, the DFT-calculated surface energies provide input to model dendrite nucleation and morphology in a lithium metal battery.

Transport (mass, charge, heat) to and through interfaces combined with reactions on the surface dictate the performance and also the degradation of these systems. To understand the fundamental material behavior of electrochemical systems, and to improve their performance and lifetime meso-scale interfacial modeling is needed that can resolve both the surface phenomena and the transport within the interfacial region.

Therefore, it is of great significance to study the plant water sources in subalpine habitats for understanding the ecological and hydrological processes in the Qilian Mountains. Here, based on the samples of precipitation, xylem water, soil water, river water, and spring water collected during May–October 2019 from subalpine habitats on the northern slope of the Qilian Mountains and the measured hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope values (δ2H and δ18O, respectively), the present study gained further insight into plant water sources in this region using the IsoSource model. Water absorption characteristics of shrubs were similar in subalpine habitats.

17,SHI YANG,Important ice processes are missed by the Community Earth system model in Southern Ocean mixed‐phase clouds: Bridging SOCRATES observations to model developments,"Global climate models (GCMs) are challenged by difficulties in simulating cloud phase and cloud radiative effect over the Southern Ocean (SO). Some of the new‐generation GCMs predict too much liquid and too little ice in mixed‐phase clouds. This misrepresentation of cloud phase in GCMs results in weaker negative cloud feedback over the SO and a higher climate sensitivity. Based on a model comparison with observational data obtained during the Southern Ocean Cloud Radiation and Aerosol Transport Experimental Study, this study addresses a key uncertainty in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) related to cloud phase, namely ice formation in pristine remote SO clouds. It is found that sea spray organic aerosols (SSOAs) are the most important type of ice nucleating particles (INPs) over the SO with concentrations 1 order of magnitude higher than those of dust INPs based on …",2023,U81692086,"YANG, SHI",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

In this new aerosol scheme, four dust modes have been designed to treat dust particles of sizes up to 20 μm. The MAM9‐simulated results are compared with those from the default four‐mode version of MAM (MAM4) and also with the in situ surface measurements of dust concentration and deposition flux, satellite‐retrieved dust extinction profile, and in situ vertical measurements of dust concentrations from the NASA Atmosphere Tomography Mission (ATom).

19,SHI YANG,Contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation and its influencing factors in the subalpine zone of Qilian Mountains,"Recycled moisture, the part of precipitating vapor that comes from surface evapotranspiration, plays an important role in the hydrological process and the feedback of the land surface-atmosphere system. In this study, we use the δ2H and δ18O data of precipitation, plant water, and surface water systematically collected in the subalpine area of the Qilian Mountains from May to October, 2019, and assess the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation based on the three-component isotopic mixing model. The results indicated that the main source of precipitating vapor comes from the advected vapor, and its contribution reaches up to 87.8 ± 1.6%. The contribution of local recycled moisture is 12.2 ± 1.6%, in which the proportion of transpiration and evaporation are 8.9 ± 0.6% and 3.3 ± 1.0%, respectively.

20,SHI YANG,Where dust comes from: Global assessment of dust source attributions with Aerocom models,"The source of dust in the global atmosphere is an important factor to better understand the role of dust aerosols in the climate system. However, it is a difficult task to attribute the airborne dust over the remote land and ocean regions to their origins since dust from various sources are mixed during long‐range transport. Recently, a multi‐model experiment, namely the AeroCom‐III Dust Source Attribution (DUSA), has been conducted to estimate the relative contribution of dust in various locations from different sources with tagged simulations from seven participating global models. The BASE run and a series of runs with nine tagged regions were made to estimate the contribution of dust emitted in East‐ and West‐Africa, Middle East, Central‐ and East‐Asia, North America, the Southern Hemisphere, and the prominent dust hot spots of the Bodélé and Taklimakan Deserts.

However, previous studies of global metacognitive biases in populations with elevated depressive/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms have not measured objective and self-reported abilities relative to normative samples, limiting the quantification of biases.

30,PAULA AUSTIN,"Reflexive co-production for urban resilience: Guiding framework and experiences from Austin, Texas","The growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have placed cities at the forefront of the human, social, economic, and ecological impacts of climate change. Extreme heat, extended freeze, excessive precipitation, and/or prolong drought impacts neighborhoods disproportionately across heterogenous urban geographies. Underserved, underrepresented, and marginalized communities are more likely to bear the burden of increased exposure to adverse climate impacts while simultaneously facing power asymmetries in access to the policy and knowledge production process. Knowledge co-production is one framework that seeks to address this convergence of disproportionate climate impact exposure and disenfranchised communities. Co-production is increasingly used in sustainability and resilience research to ask questions and develop solutions with, by, and for those communities that are most impacted. By weaving research, planning, evaluation, and policy in an iterative cycle, knowledge and action can be more closely coupled. However, the practice of co-production often lacks reflexivity in ways that can transform the science and policy of urban resilience to address equity more directly. With this, we ask what kind of co-production mechanism encourage academic and non-academic partners to reflect and scrutinize their underlying assumptions, existing institutional arrangements, and practices? How can these efforts identify and acknowledge the contradictions of co-production to reduce climate impacts in vulnerable communities?

31,PAULA AUSTIN,Application of a Large‐Scale Terrain‐Analysis‐Based Flood Mapping System to Hurricane Harvey,"Flood modeling provides inundation estimates and improves disaster preparedness and response. Recent development in hydrologic modeling and inundation mapping enables the creation of such estimates in near real time. To quantify their performance, these estimates need to be compared to measurements collected during historical events. We present an application of a flood mapping system based on the National Water Model and the Height Above Nearest Drainage method to Hurricane Harvey. The outputs are validated with high‐water marks collected to record the highest water levels during the flood.

32,PAULA AUSTIN,Effects of geologic setting on contaminant transport in deltaic aquifers,"Coastal deltaic aquifers are vulnerable to degradation from seawater intrusion, geogenic and anthropogenic contamination, and groundwater abstraction. The distribution and transport of contaminants are highly dependent on the subsurface sedimentary architecture, such as the presence of channelized features that preferentially conduct flow. Surface deposition changes in response to sea‐level rise (SLR) and sediment supply, but it remains unclear how these surface changes affect the distribution and transport of groundwater solutes in aquifers. Here, we explore the influence of SLR and sediment supply on aquifer heterogeneity and resulting effects on contaminant transport. We use realizations of subsurface heterogeneity generated by a process‐based numerical model, DeltaRCM, which simulates the evolution of a deltaic aquifer with different input sand fractions and rates of SLR. We simulate groundwater …",2022,U07369717,"AUSTIN, PAULA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
33,PAULA AUSTIN,Modeling the dynamic response of river deltas to sea‐level rise acceleration,"Climate change is raising sea levels across the globe. On river deltas, sea‐level rise (SLR) may result in land loss, saline intrusion into groundwater aquifers, and other problems that adversely impact coastal communities. There is significant uncertainty surrounding future SLR trajectories and magnitudes, even over decadal timescales. Given this uncertainty, numerical modeling is needed to explore how different SLR projections may impact river delta evolution. In this work, we apply the pyDeltaRCM numerical model to simulate 350 years of deltaic evolution under three different SLR trajectories: steady rise, an abrupt change in SLR rate, and a gradual acceleration of SLR. For each SLR trajectory, we test a set of six final SLR magnitudes between 5 and 40 mm/yr, in addition to control runs with no SLR. We find that both surface channel dynamics as well as aspects of the subsurface change in response to higher …",2022,U07369717,"AUSTIN, PAULA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
34,PAULA AUSTIN,From grains to plastics: Modeling nourishment patterns and hydraulic sorting of fluvially transported materials in deltas,"Understanding the way fluvially transported materials are partitioned in river deltas is essential for predicting their morphological change and the fate of environmental constituents and contaminants. Translating water‐based partitioning estimates into fluxes of nonwater materials is often difficult to constrain because most materials are not uniformly distributed in the water column and may have characteristic transport pathways that differ from the mean flow. Here, we present a novel reduced‐complexity modeling approach for simulating the patterns of transport of a diverse range of suspended fluvial inputs influenced by vertical stratification and topographic steering. We utilize a mixed Eulerian‐Lagrangian modeling approach to estimate the patterns of nourishment and connectivity in the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya Deltas in coastal Louisiana. Using the reduced‐complexity particle routing model dorado, in …",2022,U07369717,"AUSTIN, PAULA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
35,PAULA AUSTIN,Identification of flood‐prone areas with GeoFlood: Lessons learned from the Tiber River case study,"Flood mapping is a vital component for sustainable land use in flood‐prone areas. Due to the frequency of flood events, local authorities demand effective yet simple methods for the preliminary identification of flood‐prone areas at large scales to subsequently define mitigation strategies. We focus here on the workflow GeoFlood, a parsimonious model which uses only high‐resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) to define the geomorphological and hydrological information necessary for flood inundation mapping, thus allowing for large‐scale simulations at a reasonable computational cost. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the conditions under which GeoFlood is able to correctly reproduce inundation scenarios (with an assigned return period) and their flooding characteristics. Specifically, we analyze its performance over a highly urbanized area, the mid‐lower portion of the Tiber River (Italy). We …",2022,U07369717,"AUSTIN, PAULA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
36,PAULA AUSTIN,Improving channel hydrological connectivity in coastal hydrodynamic models with remotely sensed channel networks,"Coastal wetlands are nourished by rivers and periodical tidal flows through complex, interconnected channels. However, in hydrodynamic models, channel dimensions with respect to model grid size and uncertainties in topography preclude the correct propagation of tidal and riverine signals. It is therefore crucial to enhance channel geomorphic connectivity and simplify sub‐channel features based on remotely sensed networks for practical computational applications. Here, we utilize channel networks derived from diverse remote sensing imagery as a baseline to build a ∼10 m resolution hydrodynamic model that covers the Wax Lake Delta and adjacent wetlands (∼360 km2) in coastal Louisiana, USA. In this richly gauged system, intensive calibrations are conducted with 18 synchronous field‐observations of water levels taken in 2016, and discharge data taken in 2021.

Traditionally, numerical models have been used to explore the hydrodynamics of these valuable ecosystems. However, we still do not know how well such models simulate water‐level fluctuations beneath the vegetation canopy since we lack extensive field data to test the model results against observations. This study utilizes remotely sensed images of sub‐canopy water‐level change to understand how marshes drain water during falling tides. We employ rapid repeat interferometric observations from the NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar instrument to analyze the spatial variability in water‐level change within a complex of marshes in Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana.

38,PAULA AUSTIN,Intersecting Fluvial and Pluvial Inundation Estimates with Sociodemographic Vulnerability to Quantify Household Risk in Urban Areas,"Methods to estimate compound flooding at the household level are largely nonexistent outside of complex computational models. The exclusion of topographic depressions, and therefore pluvial flooding, from leading flood hazard maps is also underestimating potential exposure. Furthermore, national level exploratory analyses have yet to capture local variability in exposure and social vulnerability, which is necessary for local stakeholders to identify the inequitable distribution of flood risks. Using high resolution elevation data to approximate event specific inundation from both pluvial and fluvial sources, in conjunction with a localized social vulnerability index, we created a methodology to estimate flood risk at the household level. Our analysis uses the 2015 Memorial Day Flood in Austin, Texas as a case study and proof of concept of our estimation methodology. We show that the inclusion of pluvial flood sources increases inundation extents, with 37% of the Census Block Groups in the study area experiencing flooding from only pluvial sources. Furthermore, averaging flood depths, and therefore exposure estimates, to geographical and cartographic boundaries (e.g., Census Block Groups), masks household variability, with 80% of the Census Block Groups in the study area having a coefficient of variation around the mean flood depth exceeding 100%. Comparing our pluvial flooding estimates to a 2D hydrodynamic physical-based model, we classified household exposure accurately for 92% of the parcels. Our methodology can be used as a tool to estimate the impacts of inland compound flooding on household risk in order to provide a first …",2022,U07369717,"AUSTIN, PAULA",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art ATLAS model and identify its limitations in in-context learning, primarily due to a mismatch between pretraining and testing, as well as a restricted context length. To address these issues, we propose RAVEN, a model that combines retrieval-augmented masked language modeling and prefix language modeling. We further introduce Fusion-in-Context Learning to enhance the few-shot performance by enabling the model to leverage more in-context examples without requiring additional training or model modifications. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RAVEN significantly outperforms ATLAS and achieves results comparable to the most advanced language models in certain scenarios, despite having substantially fewer parameters. Our work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models for in-context learning and encourages further research in this direction.",2023,U70067037,"CHANG, KEVIN",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

However, previous studies have primarily relied on word dictionaries with a limited number of food words and employed common-sense categorizations to determine the healthiness of those words. To enhance the analysis of the urban food environment using LBSM data, it is crucial to develop a more comprehensive list of food-related words. Within the context, this study delves into the exploration of expanding food-related words along with their associated energy densities.This study addresses the aforementioned research gap by introducing a novel methodology for expanding the food-related word dictionary and predicting energy densities.

This paper focuses on income inequality in developing countries, particularly LDCs. First, we demonstrate the infeasibility of fiscal measures in resolving income inequality even in developed countries. Second, we show that inequality in LDCs can be largely explained by urban-rural gap. Third, we uncover the benign impacts of urbanization on urban-rural gap. This leads us to propose an out-of-box strategy—containing income inequality by promoting well-managed urbanization. Fourth, we reveal a misperception that may have contributed to the neglect of urban-rural gap in constituting national inequality.

This paper uses spatial models to analyze the impact and mechanism of producer services agglomeration on carbon efficiency of manufacturing industry based on the data from 286 prefecture-level cities and above in China. As urban spatial agglomeration is strongly influenced by the land-use policy and characterized by variegated degrees of industrial agglomeration, it shows various carbon efficiencies in China’s context. The results indicate that urban producer services agglomeration has both direct and indirect positive effects on carbon efficiency of manufacturing industry, whilst the indirect spillover effects have prominent spatial attenuation characteristics with an effective boundary of 350 kilometers. Moreover, the agglomeration of low-end producer services shows a significant positive indirect effect on carbon efficiency, whilst the high-end has both …",2022,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

In this study, a conceptual framework is developed to identify cities with mismatched land development and applied to solicit those out of 615 Chinese cities in 2008–2017 – a decade after the global financial crisis (GFC). The results indicate that, although the urban expansion impacted economic recovery after the GFC in the short term, the lack of actual demand from the population and industries caused the mismatched land development in the long term, with the most mismatched cities clustered in the northeast and northwest regions in China. In the post-GFC era, the increasing financial dependence of local governments on urban land profits accelerated the mismatched land …",2022,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Therefore, this study aims to provide a new focus for welfare economics in integrating the concept of the internal group welfare gap into overall welfare evaluation. Fuzzy mathematics is applied to calculate welfare and the concept of the Gini coefficient is used to evaluate the welfare gap. The resulting model is applied to the cities of Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Wuxi before and after rural residential land circulation (RRLC) to determine their resulting changes in welfare and welfare gap.

In response, this article builds on the insights of regime theory to develop a conceptual framework to reveal the mechanism behind China's rural spatial restructuring and seeks to explore the underlying reasons that affect the outcomes. It is found that resource adequacy, the quality of resource coalition, and the effectiveness of implementation determine the rural regime's capacity to manage spatial restructuring.

These findings are robust to model misspecification. We also investigated the mechanisms involved and underscore that housing demolition increases the quality of household accommodation on the one hand (positive effect) while decreasing household social connection and occupational stability on the other (negative effect).

This revealed that the WRMEI was decreasing due to the impact of the water resources management process. The findings demonstrate that water resources management has unintended effects: there was a gap between the expectation of water stress to be mitigated and the actual results of water stress increasing. That is caused by human activities in water utilization: (1) increasing available water resources from water transfer was not utilized sparingly in the receiving cities—increased water transfers from external sources increase domestic water consumption per capita; (2) improving water …",2024,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

The conservation and restoration of desert ecosystems play an important role in expanding global cultivated land, ensuring food security, and improving human wellbeing. However, ecosystem services and the value of GEP in deserts have been neglected. Taking the Kubuqi Desert ecosystem as an example, this study evaluated the pattens, GEP value, and its change in the Kubuqi Desert ecosystem from 2000 to 2020. Our study found that 1) over the past 20 years, the areas of wetlands, forests, grasslands, and shrubs in the Kubuqi desert ecosystem had increased by 100.65%, 6.05%, 2.24%, and 2.03%, respectively, while that of desert had decreased by 10.62%; 2) the GEP of Kubuqi in 2020 was 55.48 billion CNY, among which its sandstorm prevention value was the highest (39.39%); 3) The value of ecosystem services in the Kubuqi desert ecosystem were all increased over the 20-year period and the largest increase came from sandstorm prevention (increased by 195.09%). This study emphasizes how GEP accounting can promote desert conservation and restoration, quantifies the contribution of desert ecosystems to human wellbeing, and provides future GEP accounting suggestions for desert ecosystems. This study can provide scientific information on the conservation and restoration of global desert ecosystems.",2024,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

However, the implementation of financial incentives may have unintended consequences on intrinsic motivations, such as attitudes and environmental values, resulting in reduced levels of pro-environmental behaviors after PES compared to those observed before PES. The effect of PES schemes on participants’ motivations is not well understood. To address this gap, we conducted a quantitative analysis of motivation effects in PES schemes using 155 data points from 126 primary studies. Our study found that: 1) 54% of PES projects had a crowding-in effect, reinforcing intrinsic motivations, while 42% had a crowding-out effect, weakening intrinsic motivations; 2) PES projects with community payments were more likely to induce crowding-out due to free-riding and reduced trust; 3) compliance monitoring was a …",2024,U08076694,"ZHANG, XIAOLING",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

While CBPR fosters productive partnerships, there is increasing research on interpersonal group dynamics and the ways that intersecting factors, such as gender and ethnicity, affect the social interactions within CBPR. This paper explores the tensions inherent in large interdisciplinary community-based participatory research partnerships, through the examination of a long-standing community–academic partnership focused on advancing public health. Nine qualitative interviews were conducted between November 2019 and January 2020 with steering committee members from a long-standing collaborative partnership that conducts research to inform public health action. While the collaborative process was generally positive, we also uncovered less pleasant aspects of CBPR projects that are infrequently discussed in the literature, such as role confusion and power dynamics. Leadership style was seen as the driving force shaping how other team concerns were perceived. Not having structures in place to facilitate relationship development, or clear documentation of procedures, rules and norms, led to team complications. Team members suggested that a renewed focus on organisational structure would contribute to role clarity and organisation. The results highlight the complexity of working on interdisciplinary mixed community–academic teams, specifically the ways in which interdisciplinary, collaborative research can be a complicated, meandering process, often without clear-cut …",2022,U68215774,"SPRAGUE MARTINEZ, LINDA",SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK (SSW)

We compiled a global database of one of the most widespread invasive non-native species on Earth ? pine trees and their major fungal symbionts, ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) ? and tested the hypothesis that the associations with invasive EMF increases the invasion success of pines. We found that successful pine species invasions are better explained by their association with invasive EMF than by aboveground plant traits that are typically used to explain plant invasiveness. Late-successional invasive EMF were most closely related to pine invasion success, implying that this subset of introduced EMF species might be key to sustain the invasion of their hosts.

Deep venous thrombosis is a common complication in cancer survivors and can be potentially fatal. The current murine venous thrombosis models typically involve a complete or partial mechanical occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) using a suture. This procedure induces a total or partial stasis of blood and endothelial damage, triggering thrombogenesis. The current models have limitations such as higher variability in clot weights, significant mortality rate, and prolonged learning curve.

Using a syngeneic colon cancer xenograft mouse model, we employed customized vascular clips to ligate the infrarenal vena cava. These clips allow residual lip space similar to a 5-0 polypropylene suture after IVC ligations. Mice with the suture method served as controls. The vascular clip method resulted in a consistent reproducible partial vascular occlusion and greater clot weights with less variability than the suture method. The larger clot weights, greater clot mass, and clot to the IVC luminal surface area were expected due to the higher pressure profile of the vascular clips compared to a 6-0 polypropylene suture. The approach was validated by gray scale ultrasonography, which revealed consistently greater clot mass in the infrarenal vena cava with vascular clips compared to the suture method.

A combination of density functional theory (DFT) and continuum-level computational fluid dynamics is used to study the effects of surface energy on dendrite nucleation and growth. For a series of defects and concentrations, the DFT-calculated surface energies provide input to model dendrite nucleation and morphology in a lithium metal battery. The results suggest that different impurities can cause either an increase or …",2024,U39878636,"SHARIFZADEH, SAHAR",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis will likely further exacerbate the burden on food systems. Pacific Island leaders have adopted a range of food policies and regulations to improve diets. This includes taxes and regulations on compositional standards for salt and sugar in foods or school food policies. Despite increasing evidence for the effectiveness of such policies globally, there is a lack of local context-specific evidence about how to implement them effectively in the Pacific.Our 5-year collaborative project will test the feasibility and effectiveness of policy interventions to reduce salt and sugar consumption in Fiji and Samoa, and examine factors that support sustained implementation.

It is likely that it is not as much about the nutrients in the food or even how tasty the food is as it is about the circumstances in which your food was sourced, prepared, and eaten, and the connections you have with the people involved.Indigenous knowledge systems teach us that connections with nature and culture are central to our identity and that food is central to those connections [1]. Food connects us to the land, oceans and sky that sustain us, as well as to our cultures. Food helps us know where we are from,‘who we are’and to ‘feel good about ourselves’[2]. Community is the level of society where food-related connections to people and place occur. As such, community needs to be at the centre of future food systems in the same way food markets are at the centre of our villages, towns and cities. Increased interaction between farmers and consumers may help to achieve more environmentally sustainable food supply chains [3]. It may also reduce the stranglehold that global food manufacturers have on food supply and decrease the supply of ultra-processed foods [4]. Community, school and home gardens will improve food literacy and accessibility, and the affordability of healthy foods [5]. Where people are separated from community and culture due to climate change, conflict or economic opportunities, food can help bring them back together [6].",2022,U38590717,"BELL, ANDREW",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater hydrochemistry is vital to understand groundwater water-salt migration processes in the context of land use change, while it is not well known in the oasis-desert region of arid inland basins. Here, to investigate the influences of land use change on groundwater hydrochemistry and suggest sustainable management, 67 water samples were obtained in the Luntai Oasis, a typical oasis desert of Central Asia. Stable isotopes and chemical components of samples were analyzed. Piper and Gibbs plots were used to elaborate the chemical type and major mechanisms controlling water chemistry, respectively. The results showed that cultivated land area has markedly expanded in the Luntai Oasis over the last 20 years (increasing by 121.8%). Groundwater seasonal dynamics and groundwater–surface water interaction were altered dramatically by farmland expansion and groundwater exploitation. Specifically, the spatial heterogeneity and seasonal variability of groundwater hydrochemistry were significant. Compared with the desert area, the δ18O and TDS of river water and shallow groundwater in the oasis cropland exhibited lower values but greater seasonal variation. Higher TDS was observed in autumn for river water, and in spring for shallow groundwater. The chemical evolution of phreatic water was mainly controlled by the evaporation-crystallization process and rock dominance, with a chemical type of Cl-SO4-Na-Mg.

The depletion of groundwater impacted by climatic variability and intense human activities could threaten water, food, and socioeconomic security in arid regions. A thorough understanding of groundwater level dynamics and its response to land-cover change is necessary for groundwater management and ecosystem improvement, which are poorly understood in arid desert regions due to a scarcity of field monitoring data. In our study, spatiotemporal characteristics of groundwater level impacted by land-cover change and its relationship with vegetation were examined using 3-years in-situ monitoring data of 30 wells in the desert regions of Tarim Basin during 2019–2021. The results showed that the depth to groundwater level (DGL) exhibited obvious spatial and seasonal variations, and the fluctuation of DGL differed significantly among the wells.

Annual average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values increased with time during the period in the plains. DGL generally exhibited a weakly increasing trend from 2019 to 2021, mainly due to human activities. Land-cover change significantly affected the groundwater level dynamic.

Here, we characterize a typical agglutinate particle from Chang’E-5 samples and demonstrate the transport behavior of volatiles through the porous structure. The results of surface and 3D structural characterization indicate that the formation of the smooth porous structure is mainly caused by volatiles flow. Based on the element distribution analysis, we further speculate the main component of the volatiles is gas water attributed to the reduction of FeO by abundant hydrogen in the superficial lunar regolith during micrometeoroids impacts. Numerical models of volatiles (gas water) transport in the porous agglutinate have been developed for different pressure conditions. The results show the ultrafast transport of volatiles makes the superficial regolith dry and barren under high-vacuum condition. We conclude that rapid escape of volatiles can hardly retain water in the superficial lunar soil yet provides opportunities for development of ISRU technology.",2023,U35190453,"WANG, HUA",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

The policy goal should be equity—everyone has the same opportunity to be food secure—rather than equality—everyone gets the same subsidy. Since the culture and socioeconomic status within a country vary from region to region, collapsing all areas into a unique region may introduce errors and inaccurate results, as most studies carried out. This study assesses the geographical pattern of association between food security and socioeconomic factors in urban areas in Iran using a nationally and regionally representative household consumption-expenditure survey from 2010 to 2018. The logistic regression model and big data are used to achieve this goal. The results show that a substantial number of households face food insecurity in urban areas in Iran. Also, different geographic regions have various salient factors that affect food insecurity. Aggregation tests confirmed that researchers should estimate separate models for different provinces, states, and districts to assess and monitor the food security status of a country instead of estimating a unique model for the whole of the country. Geographical disparities should be considered as an important issue before suggesting any catch-all policies for a country. The geo-locational factor of households is a key determinant of the association between socioeconomic factors and food security in urban areas in Iran. In sum, the practical suggestions for improving Iranian households' food security in urban areas are as follows: (1) Developing job opportunities for the head of …",2022,U17693059,"KAHN, JOSEPH H",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Some important dynamic econometric issues are discussed in an appendix. Also, a more complex economic systems model with explicit banking and financial sectors for the Chinese economy is presented for further, more sophisticated modeling work. As a first approximation, the current modeling results show that BRI will certainly not harm the Chinese economy; but the low demand scenario does not translate into great gains either. The high demand longer term scenario is much more attractive for the economic policymakers in China. However, even in that instance the economic consequences alone cannot justify the strategic importance given to BRI by the Chinese rulers. One possible conclusion is that the geopolitical motives are the main drivers of BRI with modest prospects of economic gains but real prospects of energy security and overall trade and investment security.

Using the ideas of disorder at the micro level and the emergence of order at the macro level out of this disorder, the capitalist order/disorder dynamics in the developing economies is explored theoretically and empirically. The classical idea of real competition  can be used to explore how a crisis-ridden dynamics of uneven development emerges particularly for the DEs as part of the GCO dynamics. Some limits of policies and of the so-called developmental state capacities can be identified through this analysis.

Cereal straw biomass is an attractive source of feedstock for green technologies but lignin, a key determinant of feedstock recalcitrance, complicates bio-conversion processes. However, manipulating lignin content to improve the conversion process could negatively affect agronomic traits. An alternative approach is to manipulate lignin composition which influences the physical and chemical properties of straw. This study validates the function of a barley ferulate 5-hydroxylase gene and demonstrates that its downregulation using the RNA-interference approach substantially impacts lignin composition. We identified five barley genes having putative ferulate 5-hydroxylase activity. Downregulation of HvF5H1 substantially reduced the lignin syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in straw while the lignin content, straw mechanical properties, plant growth habit, and grain characteristics all remained unaffected. Metabolic profiling revealed significant changes in the abundance of 173 features in the HvF5H1-RNAi lines. The drastic changes in the lignin polymer of transgenic lines highlight the plasticity of barley lignification processes and the associated potential for manipulating and improving lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for green technologies. On the other hand, our results highlight some differences between the lignin biosynthetic pathway in barley, a temperate climate grass, and the warm climate grass, rice, and underscore potential diversity in the lignin biosynthetic pathways in grasses.",2023,U24962746,"WISCO, JONATHAN J.",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
125,JONATHAN J. WISCO,Pinoresinol rescues developmental phenotypes of Arabidopsis phenylpropanoid mutants overexpressing FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE,"Most phenylpropanoid pathway flux is directed toward the production of monolignols, but this pathway also generates multiple bioactive metabolites. The monolignols coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol polymerize to form guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units in lignin, components that are characteristic of plant secondary cell walls. Lignin negatively impacts the saccharification potential of lignocellulosic biomass. Although manipulation of its content and composition through genetic engineering has reduced biomass recalcitrance, in some cases, these genetic manipulations lead to impaired growth. The reduced-growth phenotype is often attributed to poor water transport due to xylem collapse in low-lignin mutants, but alternative models suggest that it could be caused by the hyper- or hypoaccumulation of phenylpropanoid intermediates. In Arabidopsis thaliana, overexpression of FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE (F5H) shifts …",2023,U24962746,"WISCO, JONATHAN J.",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)
126,JENNIFER DAVIDS,Symbiotic nitrogen fixation does not stimulate soil phosphatase activity under temperate and tropical trees,"Symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing plants can enrich ecosystems with N, which can alter the cycling and demand for other nutrients. Researchers have hypothesized that fixed N could be used by plants and soil microbes to produce extracellular phosphatase enzymes, which release P from organic matter. Consistent with this speculation, the presence of N-fixing plants is often associated with high phosphatase activity, either in the soil or on root surfaces, although other studies have not found this association, and the connection between phosphatase and rates of N fixation—the mechanistic part of the argument—is tenuous. Here, we measured soil phosphatase activity under N-fixing trees and non-fixing trees transplanted and grown in tropical and temperate sites in the USA: two sites in Hawaii, and one each in New York and Oregon.

By definition, microfluidic ECMs contain open and/or blind-ended channels with diameters on the order of 100 μm or smaller. They are designed to be immediately perfusable, and thus do not rely on biological tubulogenesis to form lumens. Methods to create the microfluidic networks can be applied to a broad range of matrix compositions and network geometries and topologies. When lined by a monolayer of endothelium or epithelium, a microfluidic ECM can be converted into a microvascular or epithelial model.

Unfortunately, how a structure absorbs energy during an impact event is difficult to predict using traditional methods, such as finite element analysis, because of the complex interactions during high strain-rate compression. Here, we employ a physics-based model to predict impact performance of structures using a single quasistatic experiment and refine that model using intermediate strain rate and impact testing to account for strain-rate dependent strengthening. This model is trained and evaluated using experiments on additively manufactured generalized cylindrical shells.

In the linear regime, heat transport is governed by the well-understood parabolic partial differential heat equation and its many extensions, with antecedents dating back to Fourier. The relaxation of the temperature from a point impulsive source of heat in a homogeneous medium in d dimensions is scale free and asymptotically follows a power law decay in time ∼t–d/2. It is therefore interesting that many recent experiments have used Newton’s law of cooling, an ordinary differential equation that yields exponential decays with a single time constant. We show that the observed apparent exponential decays in photothermal microscopy are set by externalities such as the sample cell design, experimental finite excitation pulse width, and spatial resolution and should still contain a power law …",2024,U21692406,"SANDER, MICHELLE",COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (ENG)

However, liquid water has been a limiting factor in mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy due to its high absorption spanning across the molecular fingerprint region so that cellular imaging is often performed in less absorbing heavy water instead. Time-resolved measurements via boxcar detection enable the separation of water background and reveal how heat transfer dynamics across aqueous interfaces strongly depend on hydration and the surrounding environment.

Recent efforts to improve these standard candles have focused on incorporating the effects of dust on distance measurements with SNe Ia. In this paper, we use the state-of-the-art Dark Energy Survey 5 year sample to evaluate two different families of dust models: empirical extinction models derived from SNe Ia data, and physical attenuation models from the spectra of galaxies. Among the SNe Ia-derived models, we find that a logistic function of the total-to-selective extinction RV best recreates the correlations between supernova distance measurements and host galaxy properties, though an additional 0.02 magnitudes of grey scatter are needed to fully explain the scatter in SNIa brightness in all cases. These empirically-derived extinction distributions are highly incompatible with the physical attenuation models from galactic spectral measurements. From these results, we conclude that SNe Ia must either preferentially select extreme ends of galactic dust distributions, or that the characterisation of dust along the SNe Ia line-of-sight is incompatible with that of galactic dust distributions.",2024,U97863359,"BROUT, DILLON",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

138,RUI HUA,Parrot: Enhancing multi-turn chat models by learning to ask questions,"Impressive progress has been made on chat models based on Large Language Models (LLMs) recently; however, there is a noticeable lag in multi-turn conversations between open-source chat models (e.g., Alpaca and Vicuna) and the leading chat models (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4). Through a series of analyses, we attribute the lag to the lack of enough high-quality multi-turn instruction-tuning data. The available instruction-tuning data for the community are either single-turn conversations or multi-turn ones with certain issues, such as non-human-like instructions, less detailed responses, or rare topic shifts. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Parrot, a highly scalable solution designed to automatically generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, which are then used to enhance the effectiveness of chat models in multi-turn conversations. Specifically, we start by training the Parrot-Ask model, which is designed to emulate real users in generating instructions. We then utilize Parrot-Ask to engage in multi-turn conversations with ChatGPT across a diverse range of topics, resulting in a collection of 40K high-quality multi-turn dialogues (Parrot-40K). These data are subsequently employed to train a chat model that we have named Parrot-Chat. We demonstrate that the dialogues gathered from Parrot-Ask markedly outperform existing multi-turn instruction-following datasets in critical metrics, including topic diversity, number of turns, and resemblance to human conversation.

Green municipal bonds provide the best opportunity for detailed empirical study of how pricing and ownership differ from those of ordinary bonds. Green bonds are issued at a small premium of several basis points over similar ordinary bonds except when they are issued simultaneously with ordinary bonds from the same issuer; in that situation, a premium emerges over time on the secondary market.

We use a new measure that applies LLM to 10-K Item 1 Business Description to quantify a firm's focus on climate solutions. To validate this measure, we demonstrate a strong correlation to measures of green patents, green revenues, and climate opportunities discussed during earnings calls. We find that firms with higher climate solutions have superior revenue growth, but also lower profitability margin, attributable to higher cost of goods sold, labor costs, and investments in innovation. Topic analysis shows that the revenue growth is concentrated in climate solutions with higher abatement potential, whereas expenses are higher in climate solutions with higher costs per abatement. We further distinguish between companies primarily dedicated to climate solutions (Pure) and those progressively aligning their product portfolios (Transition), and find that the higher revenue growth is concentrated in Transition firms, whereas lower profitability margin is concentrated in Pure firms. This study underscores the utility of LLMs in analyzing regulated financial documents to assess the economic impact of climate solutions, highlighting their influence on growth, profitability, investments, and operating costs.",2024,U90273063,"WILLIAMS, CHARLES",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Given the physiological pathways through which hormonal contraception may interact with menstruation, a growing body of work has documented the extent to which hormonal method use might be associated with increased hemoglobin levels and reductions in the risk of anemia in women. While these findings are promising, the scope for causal inference from these studies is restricted by their cross-sectional design, which limits the extent to which bias from individual-level confounding can be mitigated.MethodsWe assess the relationship between women’s use of hormonal contraception and their risk of anemia using three years of annual woman-level panel data on 2143 women from urban Malawi controlling for individual woman fixed effects.

This concept captures the soft aerial vehicle's fundamental dynamics with a minimum number of states and inputs but retains the main features to consider when designing control laws. Unlike conventional PVTOL and multi-rotors, where altering position inevitably impacts orientation due to their underactuated design, the Soft-PVTOL offers the unique advantage of separating these dynamics, opening doors to unparalleled maneuverability and precision. We demonstrate that the Soft-PVTOL can be modeled using the Euler-Lagrange equations by assuming a constant curvature model in the aerial robot's arms. Such a mathematical model is presented in detail and can be extended to several constant curvature segments in each Soft-PVTOL arm. Moreover, we design a passivity-based control law that exploits the flexibility of the robot's arms.

145,KAYHAN BATMANGHELICH,"Route, Interpret, Repeat: Blurring the line between post hoc explainability and interpretable models","The current approach to ML model design is either to choose a flexible Blackbox model and explain it post hoc or to start with an interpretable model. Blackbox models are flexible but difficult to explain, whereas interpretable models are designed to be explainable. However, developing interpretable models necessitates extensive ML knowledge, and the resulting models tend to be less flexible, offering potentially subpar performance compared to their Blackbox equivalents. This paper aims to blur the distinction between a post hoc explanation of a BlackBox and constructing interpretable models. We propose beginning with a flexible BlackBox model and gradually \emph{carving out} a mixture of interpretable models and a \emph{residual network}. Our design identifies a subset of samples and \emph{routes} them through the interpretable models. The remaining samples are routed through a flexible residual network. We adopt First Order Logic (FOL) as the interpretable model's backbone, which provides basic reasoning on concepts retrieved from the BlackBox model. On the residual network, we repeat the method until the proportion of data explained by the residual network falls below a desired threshold. Our approach offers several advantages. First, the mixture of interpretable and flexible residual networks results in almost no compromise in performance.

The increased pressure loss following a fractional increase in heat transfer, as well as the complex manufacturing design, leave room for improvement. The present work proposes a novel diverging–converging base corrugation model coupled with vortex generation using simple geometrical modifications across rectangular microchannels to ensure a superior performance. The Nusselt number, friction factor, and flow phenomenon were numerically studied across a Reynolds number range of 50–1000. The optimum cross-section of the microchannel-generating vortices was determined after thorough study, and base corrugation was further added to improve heat transfer. For the vortex–corrugation modeling, the heat transfer enhancement was verified in two optimized cases: (1) curved corrugated model, (2) interacting corrugated model. In the first case, an optimized curve generating Dean vortices was coupled with base corrugation. An overall increase in the Nusselt number of up to 32.69% and the thermal performance of “1.285 TPF” were observed at a high Reynolds number. The interacting channels with connecting bridges of varying width were found to generate vortices in the counter-flow configuration.

In this paper, we have undertaken a systematic scoping review of the English-language literature (2014–2019) on metropolitanisation and metropolitan governance, with a view to understanding the potential relationship with more sustainable land management. Our scoping review identified several dominant trends within current research on metropolitanisation and metropolitan governance illustrating the complexity between sustainable land management and issues of territorial politics, resourcing, and power relations. The centrality of collaborative working relationships in supporting sustainable land management is identified, yet collaboration and effective metropolitan scale governance is not always an easy task or readily implemented. The paper identifies a series of challenges and concludes that while there is general consensus that the metropolitan arena may be an appropriate scale through which to support more sustainable land management, there is no agreement on the mechanisms to enable this.

The results also indicate that a long-term orientation positively moderated the relationship between energy-saving intention, behaviours, and habits, but collectivism only moderated the nexus between energy-saving behaviours and habits. These findings imply that policymakers should focus on conveying information related to energy conservation among surrounding people, increasing citizens’ awareness of the consequences, personal responsibilities, moral obligations regarding saving energy, and should not neglect the informative role of cultural values in energy conservation practices.

Low thermal conductivity is commonly observed in anharmonic and strongly disordered materials, yet a microscopic understanding of the correlation to atomic motion is often lacking. Here we report that molecular insertion into an existing two-dimensional layered lattice structure creates a hybrid superlattice with extremely low thermal conductivity. Vibrational characterization and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal strong damping of transverse acoustic waves and significant softening of longitudinal vibrations. Together with spectral correlation analysis, we demonstrate that the molecular insertion creates liquid-like atomic motion in the existing lattice framework, causing a large suppression of heat conduction.

191,JIAWEI ZHAO,Photomolecular Effect Leading to Water Evaporation Exceeding Thermal Limit,"We report the discovery of photomolecular effect: cleavage of water clusters off surfaces by photons. This effect is demonstrated through surprising absorption of partially wetted hydrogel in the visible spectrum where both water and hydrogel materials' absorption are negligible. Illumination of hydrogel under solar or visible-spectrum light-emitting-diode leads to evaporation rates exceeding the thermal evaporation limit, even in hydrogels without additional absorbers. Measurements of temperature and transmission spectrum of vapor above evaporating surfaces show clear signatures of water clusters. The photomolecular effect happens at liquid-vapor interface due to large electrical field gradients and quadrupole force on molecular clusters. This photomolecular evaporation process might be happening widely in nature, potentially impacting climate and plants growth, and can be exploited for clean water and drying technologies.",2022,U76332027,"ZHAO, JIAWEI",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Their preference for green goods induces consumption premia on expected returns, which counterbalance the green premium stemming from their preferences for green assets. Because they provide a hedge when green goods become expensive, brown assets command lower consumption premia, while green investors allocate a larger share of their portfolios towards them.

194,MAXIME SAUZET,Green intermediary asset pricing,"Can environmentally-minded investors impact the cost of capital of green firms even when they invest through financial intermediaries? To answer this and related questions, I build an equilibrium intermediary asset pricing model with three investors, two risky assets, and a riskless bond. Specifically, two heterogeneous retail investors invest via a financial intermediary who decides on the portfolio allocation that she offers between a green and a brown equity. Both retail investors and the financial intermediary can tilt towards the green asset, beyond pure financial considerations. Perhaps surprisingly, the green retail investor can have substantial impact on the pricing of green assets, even when she invests via an intermediary who does not tilt: a sizable green premium--that is, a lower cost of capital--can emerge on the equity of the green firm. This good news comes with important qualifications, however: the green retail investor has to take large leveraged positions in the portfolio offered by the intermediary, her strategy must be inherently state-dependent, and economic conditions or the specification of preferences can overturn or limit the result. When the financial intermediary decides (or is made) to tilt instead, the impact on the green premium is substantially larger, although it is largest when preference are aligned with retail investors. I also study what happens when the green retail investor does not know the weights in the portfolio offered by the intermediary, the potential impact of greenwashing, and the effect of portfolio constraints. Taken together, these findings highlight the central role that financial intermediaries can play in channeling (or …",2024,U06188395,"SAUZET, MAXIME",QUESTROM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS (QST)

While research on methane emissions from oil and gas production has grown rapidly, there is comparatively limited information on the distribution of impacts of this sector on air quality and associated health impacts. Understanding the contribution of air quality and health impacts of oil and gas can be useful for designing mitigation strategies. Here we assess air quality and human health impacts associated with ozone, fine particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide from the oil and gas sector in the US in 2016, and compare this impact with that of the associated methane emissions. We find that air pollution in 2016 from the oil and gas sector in the US resulted in 410 000 asthma exacerbations, 2200 new cases of childhood asthma and 7500 excess deaths, with $77 billion in …",2023,U67793350,"BUONOCORE, JONATHAN",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)

Traffic‐related air pollution disproportionately affects environmental justice (EJ) communities—neighborhoods that have disproportionate exposure to environmental hazards, but health impact assessments rarely center EJ issues or prioritize the concerns of EJ communities. One explanation for the lack of focus on EJ communities is that both policymakers and academia have often failed to engage these communities. In this paper, academic researchers collaborate with seven EJ organizations in the northeastern US, working with collaboration advisors and facilitators, to design and evaluate potential transportation emissions reduction scenarios using air quality and health benefits modeling tools.

202,JONATHAN BUONOCORE,Assessing the climate and health impacts of energy consumption in European Union countries,"Burning fossil fuels for energy generation emits greenhouse gases (GHGs) that are the major driver of global climate change and its cascading health impacts. Combusting these fuels also generates air pollutants that pose an immediate health burden. Carbon and GHG emissions are routinely counted in climate policies and energy-efficiency standards and targets, yet the health burden of air pollution emission is rarely quantified. Here, we developed a modeling framework to estimate climate and health impacts of energy consumption in European Union (EU) countries. Our findings show that both climate and health impacts exhibit notable variations among EU countries depending on their energy source mix. For example, in Sweden the climate (0.5 €/MWh) and health (1.4 €/MWh) impacts of electricity consumption were significantly lower than the climate (15.3 €/MWh) and health (995 €/MWh) impacts in Bulgaria. In countries where coal or oil dominates energy supply, the health impacts can be larger than climate impacts by a factor greater than 10. For instance, Greece had 23.8 €/MWh in climate impacts and 654 €/MWh in health impacts. We also found that using fuel sources that can be “carbon neutral”, like biomass, can yield dramatically different health impact results. For example, Estonia and Poland had comparable levels of climate impacts (32.4 and 28.4 €/MWh, respectively) due to their similar shares of solid fossil fuels and renewable energy for electricity production. However, the health impacts in Estonia (1508 €/MWh) were five times that in Poland (284 €/MWh), and one of the key reasons is the use of biomass in Estonia.

By decreasing the sunlight reaching Earth's surface, geoengineering may help mitigate anthropogenic climate change, but changing sunlight also alters the rates of chemical reactions throughout the troposphere. Using the GEOS‐Chem atmospheric chemistry model, we show that stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) with sulfate, a frequently studied solar geoengineering method, can perturb tropospheric composition over a span of 10 years, increasing tropospheric oxidative capacity by 9% and reducing methane lifetime. SAI decreases the overall flux of shortwave radiation into the troposphere, but increases flux at certain UV wavelengths due to stratospheric ozone depletion. These radiative changes, in turn, perturb tropospheric photochemistry, driving chemical feedbacks that can substantially influence the seasonal and …",2023,U67793350,"BUONOCORE, JONATHAN",SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (SPH)

Based on in situ observational data from four locations in the coastal area of the northern Beibu Gulf and satellite data, we analyzed the changes in temperature, salinity, and turbidity during the transit of TS “Wipha” in 2019 and assessed the environmental factors controlling chlorophyll a concenteation (Chl-a) increases in the coastal area. Our results showed that in the coastal area, the growth of phytoplankton after the TS was mainly controlled by the nutrient and light availability. The increased input of freshwater by TS, including direct inputs from rainfall and increased river discharge, reduced the salinity. The decrease in salinity may indicate an increased input of nutrient-rich freshwater at all four stations (nutrients input: S1>S2>S3>S4). Nutrient concentration at S1, S2, and S3 implied by salinity was high, but that at S4 was limited. The shorter recovery time of turbidity after TS indicated the faster improvement of light conditions in this area [recovery time: S4 (2 days)< S1 (3 days)< S3 (5 days)< S2 (10 days)]. The high turbidity associated with poor light penetration was an important factor limiting phytoplankton growth at station 2, with a slow recovery of the turbidity to pre-TS levels. The rapid recovery of the turbidity to the pre-TS levels at S1, S3, and S4 suggested good light conditions soon after the TS, and probably led to a significant increase in Chl-a after the TS ([Chl-a]: S1>S3>S4). The less of an increase of Chl-a at S4 was not only related to nutrient restriction but also related to weak mixing of the water column, while the least …",2022,U66600219,"PAN, JOHN",SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM)

Many researchers attribute these health disparities among TGD populations, including high rates of psychiatric and substance use disorders, to minority stress, a social and public health framework describing how the long-term effects of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination create a hostile environment that impacts a person’s health and well-being. An important corollary of this model is the concept of resilience—the coping strategies that enable minority populations to thrive amid adversity on both the individual and community levels. This chapter explores the health disparities experienced by TGD populations, and delineates the minority stress model and multilevel interventions that address individual, institutional, organizational, and societal/public policy issues. area. 3 More recently, increases in the volume of research on TGD populations, improvements in the quality of data inclusive of gender identity, and advancements in methodology for identifying TGD individuals in existing dataset have amplified evidence of significant inequities in health.

221,SARAH DAVIES,Comparative Fuel Yield from Anaerobic Digestion of Emerging Waste in Food and Brewery Systems,"Food waste (FW), a major part of the US waste stream, causes greenhouse gases within landfills, but there is an opportunity to divert FW to anaerobic digestion (AD) facilities that produce biogas and digestate fertilizer. The composition of FW inputs to AD determines the value of these products. This study provides insight into the effect of waste composition on the quality of AD products by first characterizing the biogas and digestate quality of anaerobically digested FW from four diets (paleolithic, ketogenic, vegetarian, and omnivorous), and then estimating the difference in biogas produced from codigested FW and brewery waste (BW). Waste feedstock mixtures were incubated in lab-scale bioreactors for 21 days with live inoculum. Biogas quality was monitored for 21–30 days in four trials. Samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph for detection of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The composition of the waste inputs had a significant impact on the quality of biogas but not on the quality of the digestate, which has implications for the value of post-AD fertilizer products. Wastes with higher proportions of proteins and fats enhanced biogas quality, unlike wastes that were rich in soluble carbohydrates. Codigestion of omnivorous food waste with carbon-rich agricultural wastes (AW) improved biogas quality, but biogas produced from BW does not necessarily improve with increasing amounts of AW in codigestion.",2022,U65605891,"DAVIES, SARAH",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

Despite the traditional two-dimensional description of upwelling as a passive response to surface offshore Ekman transport, recent observations have revealed spatial variability in the circulation structures across different upwelling locations. Yet, a systematic understanding of the factors governing the spatial patterns of coastal upwelling remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that coastal upwelling pathways are influenced by two pairs of competing factors. The first competition occurs between wind forcing and eddy momentum flux, which shapes the Eulerian-mean circulation; the second competition arises between the Eulerian-mean and eddy-induced circulation.

However, the molecular processes underlying these neurodevelopmental changes are still elusive, preventing an understanding of the mechanistic basis of ID in DS. In this study, we used a pair of isogenic (trisomic and euploid) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to generate cortical spheroids (CS) that model the impact of trisomy 21 on brain development. Cortical spheroids contain neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and they are widely used to approximate early neurodevelopment. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we uncovered cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the trisomic CS. In particular, we found that excitatory neuron populations were most affected and that a specific population of cells with a transcriptomic profile resembling layer IV cortical neurons displayed the most profound divergence in developmental trajectory between trisomic and euploid genotypes. We also identified candidate genes potentially driving the developmental asynchrony between trisomic and euploid excitatory neurons. Direct comparison between the current isogenic CS scRNA-seq data and previously published datasets revealed several recurring differentially expressed genes between DS and control samples.

At the same time, the recent increase of renewable electricity and the need of large scale electricity storage provide a great opportunity to produce hydrogen and valuable carbon from natural gas by taking advantage of its abundant resource. The predominant commercial method for production of hydrogen and carbon from natural gas is the high temperature thermal cracking process. However, the thermal cracking method has low yield and produces less valuable carbon but large amounts of polluting emissions (e.g. CO2 and NOx). With the availability of excess renewable electricity at peak hours, an environmentally benign plasma synthesis method for hydrogen and valuable carbon production has become very attractive …",2022,U35015123,"PATTERSON, ROBERT",COLLEGE OF FINE ARTS (CFA)

In this study, we propose a semi-analytical method, which can be applied to Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images to retrieve high spatial-resolution total suspended solids (TSS) concentration in a broad spectrum of aquatic ecosystems ranging from clear to extremely turbid waters. The presented approach has four main steps. First, the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at a band lacking in MSI (620 nm) is estimated through an empirical relationship from Rrs at 665 nm. Second, waters are classified into four types (clear, moderately turbid, highly turbid, and extremely turbid). Third, semi-analytical algorithms are used to estimate the particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp) at a reference band depending on the water types.

260,CEDRIC FICHOT,"Coupling numerical models of deltaic wetlands with AirSWOT, UAVSAR, and AVIRIS-NG remote sensing data","Coastal marsh survival relies upon to their ability to increase their elevation and offset sea level rise. It is therefore fundamental to realistically model the sediment fluxes between marshes, tidal channels and bays. Traditionally, numerical models have been calibrated and validated using in-situ measurements located in few locations within the domain of interest. These datasets typically provide temporal information but lack spatial variability. This paper explores the potential of coupling numerical models with high resolution remote sensing imagery. Products from three sensors from the recent NASA Delta-X airborne mission are used. UAVSAR provides vertical water level change on the marshland, and was used to adjust the bathymetry and calibrate the water fluxes over the marsh. AirSWOT yields water surface elevation within bays, lakes and channels and was used to calibrate the Chezy bottom friction coefficient. Finally, imagery from AVIRIS-NG provide maps of total suspended solids (TSS) concentration that were used to calibrate sediment parameters of settling velocity and critical shear stress for erosion. Three numerical models were developed at different locations and scales along coastal Louisiana using Delft3D. The coupling enabled a spatial evaluation of model performance not possible using simple point measurements. Some limitations were highlighted in the remote sensing imagery and the numerical models that need to be accounted for when comparing the results.

The selection of sites can be guided by simple habitat suitability models driven with environmental variables deemed critical to the successful growth of new transplants. Habitat suitability models typically consider the influence of bathymetry, sediment type, salinity, wave exposure, and water quality. However, they typically do not explicitly include benthic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) and commonly use depth as a coarse proxy for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

It provides a comprehensive overview of each model’s efficacy in capturing volatility clustering, asymmetry, and long-term memory effects in asset returns. By employing models like sGARCH, eGARCH, gjrGARCH, and FIGARCH, the research offers a nuanced understanding of volatility evolution and its impact on asset returns. Using the Skewed Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) in model optimization shows how important it is to understand asymmetry and fat-tailedness in return distributions, which are common in financial data. Key findings include the sGARCH model being the preferred choice for Gold Futures due to its lower AIC value and favorable parameter estimates, indicating significant volatility clustering and a slight positive skewness in return distribution. For Cocoa Futures, the FIGARCH model demonstrates superior performance in capturing long memory effects, as evidenced by its higher log-likelihood value and lower AIC value. For the S&P500 Index, the eGARCH model stands out for its ability to capture asymmetry in volatility responses, showing superior performance in both log-likelihood and AIC values. Overall, identifying superior modeling approaches like the FIGARCH model for long memory effects can enhance risk management strategies by providing more accurate estimates of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).

Engineers also need to predict the influence of environmental variables (temperature, pressure, pore-fluid chemistry) on these engineering properties. Particle-based methods, which explicitly model individual clay platelets and their interactions, can help identify the fundamental mechanisms that govern the engineering behaviour. Virtual samples can be created, and simulations can consider application of mechanical loading or change in the environmental conditions to generate data on particle kinematics and interparticle interactions.

We represent each kaolinite particle as a flat ellipsoid and calculate the total interaction energy/force between two ellipsoids as a weighted sum of face-to-face, edge-to-edge, face-to-edge, and edge-to-face interactions. The weightings of these interactions are smooth functions of the relative orientations of the particles. This model was employed in coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of virtual samples under isotropic compression to investigate the influence of the pore water pH on microfabric formation and the mechanical behaviour of kaolinite. The simulations effectively captured the influence of pore water pH on microfabric formation and compressive behaviour, as previously reported in experimental research.

Herein, the impact of the wind loads on the heliostat response under downburst is investigated using a proven finite‐element model and the influence is also compared with that under atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind. The results demonstrate that the downburst development process, the movement of the storm center, and the heliostat's elevation angle are highly associated with the wind‐induced response characteristics of the heliostat under downburst. The maximum displacement and stress of the heliostat with different elevation angles under the downburst are significantly larger than those under ABL wind.

A complete DACCS system includes the capture of CO2, its compression and transport, and storage deep underground. Some components of a DACCS system are mature technologies. For example, companies have for decades captured CO2 from oil and gas processing (and other industrial sources), transported it via pipeline, and injected it into oil and gas reservoirs to boost production.

Poverty remains a prevalent global issue due to disproportionate wealth distribution, which often translates to inequality in energy consumption and emissions. This research investigates if low-income households and minorities from four countries with very different national cultures, contexts, and levels of wealth experience a ‘double energy vulnerability’, a concept that simultaneously positions people at heightened risk of transport and energy poverty. Our research identifies that low-income households and minorities are at higher risk of simultaneously experiencing energy and transport poverty regardless of the national context in which they live.

Based on fieldwork involving original expert interviews (N = 23) and extensive site visits (N = 23) in Australia, this empirical study explores four types of climate interventions spanning climate differing degrees of radicalism: adaptation, solar geoengineering, forestry and ecosystems restoration, and carbon removal. It examines ongoing efforts to engage in selective breeding and assisted adaptation of coral species to be introduced on the Great Barrier Reef, as well as to implement regional solar geoengineering in the form of fogging and marine cloud brightening. It also examines related attempts at both nature-based and engineered forms of carbon removal vis-à-vis ecosystem restoration via forestry conservation and reforestation in the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area, and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization. This portfolio of climate interventions challenges existing categorizations and typologies of climate action. Moreover, the study identifies positive synergies and coupling between the options themselves, but also lingering trade-offs and risks needing to be taken into account. It discusses three inductive themes which emerged from the qualitative data: complexity and coupling, risk and multi-scalar effects, and radicality and governance.

Ensuring hospitals receive adequate and safe blood for transfusion is a common challenge across low- and middle-income countries, but is rarely addressed from a system level. This paper presents the first use of discrete event simulation to study the blood system in Kenya and to explore the effect of variations and perturbations at different steps of the system on meeting patient blood demand. A process map of the Kenyan blood system was developed to capture critical steps from blood donation to transfusion using interviews with blood bank, hospital, and laboratory personnel at four public hospitals across three counties in Kenya. The blood system was simulated starting with blood collection, a blood bank where blood is tested and stored before it is issued, a major hospital attached to the blood bank, and several smaller hospitals served by the same blood bank. Values for supply-side parameters were based mainly on expert opinion; demand-side parameters were based on data from blood requisitions made in hospital wards, and dispatch of blood from the hospital laboratory. Illustrative examples demonstrate how the model can be used to explore the impacts of changes in blood collection (e.g., prioritising different donor types), blood demand (e.g., differing clinical case mix), and blood distribution (e.g., restocking strategies) on meeting demand at patient level.

We examine if they can explain misallocation resulting from negative wealth effects in marginal willingness to pay for land by farming households, as observed in eastern India. We show this pattern is consistent with a model with missing markets for insurance against weather shocks, where farmers value the security provided by access to cultivable land against uncertain costs of food subsistence requirements. The security value of land is shown to be decreasing in ability and in wealth among agents of below average ability, under weak assumptions on risk preferences and patterns of heterogeneity in the population. Equilibria in the land market always feature misallocation owing to resulting biases in favor of low ability poor farmers. In contrast, in the model where land is valued as a source of collateral we find that the collateral value of land is increasing in ability and wealth. If land is perfectly collateralizable, there is no land misallocation in equilibrium. The contrasting predictions of the two models concerning the pattern of wealth effects are potentially testable, and suggest that the security value of land poses a more potent channel of persistence of land misallocation.",2024,U74548967,"MOOKHERJEE, DILIP",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

We leveraged a unique, well-characterized urban-to-rural and forest edge-to-interior gradient to identify the combined impact of these two land use changes—urbanization and forest edge creation—on the soil microbial community in native remnant forests. We found evidence of mutualism breakdown between trees and their fungal root mutualists [ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi] with urbanization, where ECM fungi colonized fewer tree roots and had less connectivity in soil microbiome networks in urban forests compared to rural forests. However, urbanization did not reduce the relative abundance of ECM fungi in forest soils; instead, forest edges alone led to strong reductions in ECM fungal abundance. At forest edges, ECM fungi were replaced …",2023,U73274179,"TEMPLER, PAMELA H",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)
346,PAMELA H TEMPLER,Early snowmelt by an extreme warming event affects understory more than overstory trees in Japanese temperate forests,"The occurrence of extreme warm events and early snowmelt is predicted to increase in high‐latitude ecosystems, even during periods of time when there is no coincident reduction in total precipitation. However, because extreme events like these occur unpredictably, little is known about how advancing snowmelt by a single extreme warm event, without a reduction in precipitation amount, influences overstory trees and understory vegetation simultaneously in an ecosystem. We conducted a warming experiment (four 20 × 20 m plots) in temperate forests of Japan to determine the effects of earlier snowmelt on both understory dwarf bamboo plants and overstory birch trees. Our experimental treatment advanced snowmelt by about 10 days and increased soil temperatures that were associated with increased rates of soil nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification.

Increasing soil C losses via respiration have been observed at rural forest edges, but this process was suppressed at urban forest edges. We offer a comprehensive, coupled investigation of abiotic soil conditions and biotic soil activity from forest edge to interior at eight sites along an urbanization gradient to elucidate how environmental stressors are linked to soil C cycling at the forest edge. Despite significant diverging trends in edge soil C losses between urban and rural sites, we did not find comparable differences in soil % C or microbial enzyme activity, suggesting an unexpected decoupling of soil C fluxes and pools at …",2023,U73274179,"TEMPLER, PAMELA H",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIS (CAS)

While urban trees in arid and semiarid ecosystems have been shown to take up water from irrigation, it is unknown where street trees in mesic cities obtain their water. In this study, we use natural abundance stable isotopes to estimate the proportional sources of water taken up by Acer platanoides street trees in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, including precipitation, irrigation, groundwater, and wastewater. We use Bayesian multisource mixing models to estimate water sources by comparing the natural abundance isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen across potential water sources with water extracted from tree stem samples.

However, it remains unknown whether atmospheric phosphorus inputs are elevated in urban areas around the world and how temperature and precipitation affects these inputs. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare atmospheric deposition of phosphorus in urban and rural sites across the globe.

Cycling of N is sensitive to changes in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and air pollution. Streamwater nitrate draining a forested ecosystem can indicate how an ecosystem is responding to these changes. We observed a pulse in streamwater nitrate concentration and export at a long-term forest research site in eastern North America that resulted in a 10-fold increase in nitrate export compared to observations over the prior decade. The pulse in streamwater nitrate occurred in a reference catchment in the 2013 water year, but was not associated with a distinct disturbance event.

Urban forests are characterized by high temperatures and elevated rates of nitrogen deposition, whereas forest edges suffer from severe drought and limited organic soil development. We hypothesized that urbanization and forest edge conditions disturb the symbiotic relationship between ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and trees, potentially replacing the fungal community with more pathogenic, copiotroph, and stress-tolerant taxa. To test this hypothesis, we collected soil samples along an urban-to-rural gradient in Massachusetts, and along edge-interior gradients at each forest site.

Urban trees provide a wealth of ecosystem services that benefit humans-from climate adaptation effects (ie cooling through shading, evapotranspiration) to reducing certain air pollutants, reducing violent crime, and improving human health outcomes. However, urban greening initiatives are limited in their ability to mitigate climate change (ie reduce greenhouse concentrations in the atmosphere), especially considering their relatively low density, and high maintenance costs, and high tree mortality rates.

Atmospheric N deposition in this region has declined since the passage of the Clean Air Act and its amendments, which coincides with lengthening growing seasons, rising air temperatures, and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Together, these factors lead to increased forest productivity and in turn increased plant demand for N. In the northern hardwood forest, warming winters bring reductions in winter snowpack and an earlier arrival of spring snowmelt, which may have profound effects on N availability to trees and their interaction with soil microbes.

However, while the influences of urbanization and forest fragmentation on atmospheric inputs to temperate forests have been determined separately, the combined effects of the two changes on temperate forest ecosystems have yet to be assessed. To investigate these combined effects, we deployed throughfall collectors to measure atmospheric N inputs and passive samplers to measure nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone (O3) throughout the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons in seven temperate forest sites along an urbanization gradient from Boston to central Massachusetts.

Urbanization and fragmentation interacted to generate “suites” of microbes, with urban interior forests harboring highly homogenized microbiomes, while edge forests microbiomes were more heterogeneous and less stable, showing increased vulnerability to low soil moisture. When scaled to the regional level, we found that forest soils are projected to harbor high abundances of fungal pathogens and denitrifying bacteria, even in rural areas, due to extreme, widespread forest fragmentation.
