# Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for using the Paper Algorithm and Web Scraper developed for retrieving and analyzing research publications. The purpose of these tools is to streamline the process of collecting metadata such as titles, abstracts, and publication years, specifically for sustainability-related research. It is important to mention what sustainability is. Here is the definition of sustainability, as stated in the project description: \n
*Sustainability Challenge â€“ An issue or situation that threatens or undermines ecological integrity, racial equity and social justice, or the ability of future generations to meet their needs (e.g., biodiversity loss, poverty and inequality, and climate change), OR a goal or objective that contributes to there solution of such an issue or situation (e.g., ecosystem health, universal human rights, and renewable energy generation). To identify sustainability challenges, it may be helpful to reference the targets embedded in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the principles outlined in the Earth Charter, and/or the Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries
Purpose of the Tools
## Paper Algorithm
Designed to retrieve publication data from Google Scholar using the Python library scholarly.
Filters and categorizes publications based on predefined sustainability-related keywords.
Facilitates large-scale data collection while handling input files in manageable chunks.
## Web Scraper
Automates interaction with the OpenBU discovery platform to extract publication data such as titles and abstracts.
Uses Selenium to simulate user interactions for authors listed in an input file.
This document provides detailed instructions on:
Setting up and using the Paper Algorithm and Web Scraper.
Methodology and key processes behind each tool.
Limitations and blockers encountered during development.
Suggestions for future teams to build upon the current work.
