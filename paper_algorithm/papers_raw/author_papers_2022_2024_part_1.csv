KRISTIN SMITH-CROWE,"A place in the world: Vulnerability, well-being, and the ubiquitous evaluation that animates participation in institutional processes","In this paper, we explain how and why people become motivated to participate in institutional processes. Responding to recent efforts to address the micro and meso in institutional analysis, we introduce two interrelated constructs—a person’s embodied world of concern and a community’s shared world of concern—which shape how people experience, evaluate, and participate in institutional arrangements. The world of concern, which is the product of people’s sedimented experiences of thriving and suffering, becomes the basis for their commitments and antagonisms toward certain social arrangements. The world of concern, as a lens, sheds light on the complex ways the macro-, meso-, and microlevels are coimplicated in constructing commitments and attachments that animate action in institutional arenas by providing a new metaphor, one that links the realism of participant concerns to the microdynamics that …",2022
KRISTIN SMITH-CROWE,The Relative Importance and Interaction of Contextual and Methodological Predictors of Mean rWG for Work Climate,"A variety of collective phenomena are understood to exist to the extent that workers agree on their perceptions of the phenomena, such as perceptions of their organization’s climate or perceptions of their team’s mental model. Researchers conducting group-level studies of such phenomena measure individuals’ perceptions via surveys and then aggregate data to the group level if the mean within-group agreement for a sample of groups is sufficiently high. Despite this widespread practice, we know little about the factors potentially affecting mean within-group agreement. Here, focusing on work climate, we report an investigation of a number of expected contextual (social interaction) and methodological predictors of mean rWG, a common statistic for judging within-group agreement in applied psychology and management research. We used the novel approach of meta-CART, which allowed us to assess the relative …",2022
KRISTIN SMITH-CROWE,Prompting and Punishing Transgressions: Interpersonal Causes and Consequences of Unethical Behavior,"Unethical behavior has disastrous consequences for organizations and society. Inspired by the conference theme “Creating a Better World Together”, this symposium brings together novel empirical insights on how people prompt and punish others’ unethical behavior. How does one person’s actions and emotions affect another’s unethical behavior? How do people react to others’ unethical behavior with constructive or counterproductive responses? The first two presentations examine how individuals intentionally or unintentionally prompt others to act unethically by giving advice (Helgason & Effron) and displaying anxiety (Yip & Lee). The next three presentations examine how people respond, often unfairly and counterproductively, to others’ unethical behavior with punishment (Kundro, Nurmohamed, Kakkar, & Affinito), ostracism (Smith-Crowe & Burns), and feedback (Frey & Green). By focusing on behaviors …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Navigating the double bind: A systematic literature review of the experiences of novice teachers of color in K–12 schools,"A robust body of U.S.-based research demonstrates the importance of teachers of color to promote positive outcomes among students of color, and recent policies aim to increase the proportion of teachers of color. These policies are unlikely to succeed if they ignore how educational systems currently marginalize teachers of color, particularly early in teachers’ careers, when they are more likely to leave. Thus, we conducted a systematic narrative review of the experiences of novice teachers of color in K–12 schools. We identified 72 relevant studies, from 1996 to the present, and qualitatively analyzed themes within them. We found that novices’ experiences of their socialization into K–12 educational institutions were deeply racialized, through their interactions with every aspect of K–12 educational systems. Novices’ experiences often placed them in a double bind, as they experienced tensions between their …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Burnout of special educators serving students with emotional-behavioral disorders: A longitudinal study,"We examined changes in burnout across three timepoints in one school year, in a sample (N = 230) of special educators serving students with emotional-behavioral disorders, in 15 school districts selected through stratified random sampling at the national level. Emotional exhaustion decreased at each timepoint in the school year and personal accomplishment increased from fall to spring. Latent growth curve modeling did not produce latent trajectories of burnout among teachers; however, cross-lagged panel structure equation modeling revealed that emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment had both direct and indirect effects on depersonalization. Differences in burnout were significant by race/ethnicity but not by gender. Participants reported higher emotional exhaustion, lower depersonalization, and higher personal accomplishment than a national sample. We provide implications for researchers …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Comparing turnover intentions and actual turnover in the public sector workforce: Evidence from public school teachers,"Many studies rely on public sector employees’ reported career intentions instead of measuring actual turnover, but research does not clearly document how these variables relate to one another. We develop and test three ways in which measures of employee intentions and turnover might relate to one another:(a) intention may measure the same underlying construct as turnover;(b) intention may be distinct from but strongly related to turnover; or (c) intentions may be distinct from turnover. Using nationally representative data on 102,970 public school teachers, we conduct a descriptive and regression analysis to probe how teachers’ turnover intentions are and are not associated with attrition. While there is some variation across measures of intent, we find evidence most consistent with the second scenario; intention is distinct from, but strongly related to, turnover. We offer recommendations for how researchers should use public sector employee intentions in research.",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Special educators’ experiences of interpersonal interactions while serving students with emotional/behavioral disorders,"Students with emotional/behavioral disorders are increasingly included in general education settings, requiring their special educators to coordinate with other educators. Yet, research provides limited insights into their interactions with other educators. Thus, we qualitatively examined how special educators experienced and navigated interactions with other educators when serving students with emotional/behavioral disabilities in self-contained classes that were actively moving students into more inclusive placements. Participants emphasized that their work was interdependent with others; they relied on others for work essential to meeting students’ needs. They shared that interactions were shaped by conceptions of students’ needs, the division of responsibilities, and resources. They experienced interactions on a continuum from alignment to misalignment; when experiencing alignment, they felt supported to …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,"Disparities in teachers’ access to schools’ collective social assets based on role, race, and poverty","A schools’ collective social assets (i.e., school culture, administrative support, and satisfied colleagues) are especially important for beginning teachers at higher risk of attrition, including special educators, teachers of color, teachers in high-poverty schools, and teachers in schools serving predominantly students of color. These teachers often report experiencing less social support than general educators, White teachers, teachers in low-poverty schools, and teachers serving predominantly White students, respectively; we labeled this inequitable access to schools’ collective social assets intersectional professional vulnerability. Using data from the Schools and Staffing Survey and structural equation modeling, we examined how beginning teachers’ race/ethnicity and their students’ race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability status related to perceptions of their U.S. schools’ collective social assets and how …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Working conditions and burnout of special educators of students with EBD: Longitudinal outcomes,"Special education teacher (SET) burnout is a significant concern, especially for SETs serving students with emotional–behavioral disorders (EBD), as they tend to experience higher burnout than other teachers. Working conditions, especially social support, have the potential to ameliorate burnout, but prior research has not articulated the sources and types of social support that are most important. The authors conducted a longitudinal study, surveying 230 SETs serving students with EBD at three time points across one school year. Data revealed administrative support, adequacy of planning time, and autonomy in fall predicted emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment in winter and spring. Associations between working conditions and burnout components were partially mediated by SETs’ perceptions of workload manageability. SET change in well-being due to COVID-19 during the early months of the …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Handbook of research on special education teacher preparation,"Research on special education teacher preparation has burgeoned in recent years, spurred by several factors. The US Department of Education continues to invest in research, preparation, and practice for educators to enter the field equipped with the knowledge and skill necessary to improve outcomes for all students, including students with disabilities. Additionally, the cadre of special education teacher education researchers continues to grow and extend its reach with methodological advancements. In this second edition of the Handbook of Research on Special Education TeacherPreparation, authors offer a comprehensive review of research on attracting, preparing, and sustaining personnel to effectively serve students with disabilities. This edition is updated to align with current knowledge and future perspectives on special educator development. Each chapter synthesizes what we know from available …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,The shifting context of special education teachers’ work,"We used five waves of nationally representative data over 16 years from the Schools and Staffing Survey, National Teacher Principal Survey, and Teacher Follow-up Survey to descriptively examine how the roles, responsibilities, preparation, and supports for special educators have changed over time. We then used regression to investigate how these variables were associated with special educator attrition. This information is essential to ensure teacher education adequately prepares special educators for the contexts in which they work. We identified some changes in special educators’ work environment, including substantially increased use of team teaching. Our results indicated special educator attrition declined from 2000 to 2012, and this decline was primarily driven by reductions in movement between schools. Regression analysis provided little insight into the variables associated with this decline …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,"Disparities in access to well-qualified, well-supported special educators across higher-versus lower-poverty schools over time","Scholars have documented long-standing disparities in access to well-qualified, well-supported teachers, including disparities in access to special education teachers (SETs), based on student socioeconomic status. In response, policy initiatives have aimed to incentivize teaching in higher-poverty schools. Thus, we examined changes over time in disparities between SETs’ demands and resources (including internal resources, such as qualifications, and school-based resources, such as adequate materials), using multiple waves of the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey. We found that, by one metric, disparities in certification have closed since 2000. However, SETs in higher poverty schools are significantly more likely to work in self-contained settings than those in lower-poverty schools, and disparities in school-based resources continue to be significant, such that SETs in higher-poverty …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,"High-quality systematic literature reviews in special education: Promoting coherence, contextualization, generativity, and transparency","High-quality systematic literature reviews provide a systematic process for identifying, synthesizing, and critiquing multiple studies and, in turn, inform theory, research, practice, and policy. With a focus on special education systematic reviews, we propose four core principles (i.e., coherence, contextualization, generativity, and transparency) to guide scholars in conducting meta-analyses, systematic narrative reviews, and qualitative meta-syntheses. Specifically, we articulate how scholars can promote each of these principles at each stage of the review process to enhance the rigor, relevance, and credibility of their systematic review: (a) framing the problem and research questions; (b) planning procedures to identify, analyze, and synthesize studies; and (c) presenting and interpreting results. Last, we discuss future directions in light of issues of equity and approaches to bridge synthesis findings and practice and policy.",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,"Special education teachers of color burnout, working conditions, and recommendations for EBD research","This article is in direct response to Garwood’s call to action about burnout and the special education teacher workforce. While Garwood’s call to action is critically needed, we contend that the call is incomplete as it lacks emphasis on factors linking sociocultural identity and burnout. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the significance of elevating sociocultural identity, specifically race and ethnicity, into research about special education teacher burnout. We argue that any research on special education teacher burnout that does not include race and ethnicity is overlooking the racialization of special education teachers’ working conditions, and ultimately is incapable of addressing one of the most pressing issues in the special education field—retaining teachers of color. Recommendations for researchers to address sociocultural identities (i.e., race and ethnicity) in their research, specifically about special education …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Experiences of working conditions among special education teachers of color serving students with EBD,"Consistent evidence indicates the importance of teachers of color for experiences and outcomes of students of color. Fortunately, extant studies consistently indicate special education teachers (SETs) teaching students with EBD are more likely to be people of color than other SETs. These SETs require supportive working conditions, but, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the experiences of SETs of color serving students with EBD. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the experiences of SETs of color who teach students with EBD, investigating how SETs of color rate their working conditions and intent to continue teaching students with EBD. Analyzing two extant data sets, we found that SETs of color experienced strong support from administrators and paraprofessionals, ratings of many working conditions did not differ by race/ethnicity, and SETs of color on average intended to stay in their jobs …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,"Self-efficacy, burnout, and intent to leave for teachers of students with emotional and behavioral disorders","Due to ongoing and severe teacher shortages, preparing and sustaining a skilled special education teacher (SET) workforce is a top policy priority. Understanding predictors of SETs’ intent to leave is crucial for policy makers and school leaders alike, as they seek to develop interventions to support retention efforts. In this study, we examined attrition intentions among SETs serving students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBDs), using longitudinal survey data from a U.S. nationally representative sample of teachers in the 2019–2020 school year (fall-winter-spring). We measured teachers’ self-efficacy and burnout in fall, winter, and spring as well as teachers’ intent to leave in spring. We found all three dimensions of fall burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment) had an indirect effect on spring intent to leave. All three dimensions of burnout in the spring …",2024

ELIZABETH BETTINI,A descriptive portrait of the paraeducator workforce in Washington State,"We use over 25 years of longitudinal data from Washington state to provide a descriptive portrait of the paraeducator workforce in the state. Paraeducators are more racially and ethnically diverse than special education teachers, particularly in the last decade, and tend to be less experienced. They also have full-time salaries that are about half of the average special education teacher salary. Paraeducator-to-student ratios have decreased over time in the state, but they are higher in schools serving more students of color. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, paraeducator attrition rates from the state’s public school workforce have increased dramatically over time; for example, the paraeducator attrition rate after the 2021-22 school year (23%) was over twice as high as the attrition rate after the 2008-09 school year (8%). These findings have implications for how policymakers and school leaders should approach decision-making related to the paraeducator workforce, as well as how researchers might approach further research with this group of educators.",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Measuring special educators’ working conditions: A systematic review,"Special education teachers’ (SETs) working conditions play a crucial role in shaping the size, quality, and effectiveness of the U.S. SET workforce and thereby shape the quality of instruction provided to students with disabilities. Valid measures of SETs’ working conditions are essential for conducting robust research on how to improve working conditions. We systematically reviewed measures of SETs’ working conditions across 44 studies, assessing evidence of validity. We find that evidence of validity for existing measures is limited but that extant measures provide a starting point for future measurement development. We urge researchers to develop valid measures in the future for use in both research and policy aimed at better supporting SETs.",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Beyond exploratory: How varied qualitative methodologies can inform and advance the field of special education,"Qualitative research has a long tradition in special education, dating back more than 200 years, when scholars first used qualitative methods to document the existence and characteristics of disabilities. To understand how widely qualitative research is used in special education, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative research published in the top ten Council for Exception Children (CEC) journals from 2006 to 2020, finding published special education scholars are seldom taking advantage of the rich, varied traditions of qualitative methodologies. Thus, in this chapter we aim to provide an introduction to seven major qualitative methodologies, and exemplar studies, to support scholars in understanding and selecting among the wide range of available qualitative methodologies. We conclude with key considerations for scholars as they undertake a qualitative study.",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Are paraprofessionals being hired to replace special educators? A study of paraprofessional employment,"Special education teacher employment began to decline in 2006, concurrent with increased paraprofessional employment. At the same time, the prevalence of students with disabilities in several categories changed substantially, and the proportion of students being served in general education settings increased as well. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the decline in special education teacher employment was related to increased paraprofessional employment, and if the increase in paraprofessional employment was related to shifts in the composition of students with disabilities, educational placements, or more general state-level factors. We created a panel dataset for 2006–2015 and analyzed these relationships using a two-way fixed effects model. We found that, although changes in paraprofessional employment were unrelated to changes in special educator employment, they were related …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Momentary affective experiences of teachers serving students with emotional and behavioral disabilities in self-contained settings,"Emotions play an important role in the work of teachers serving students with emotional and behavioral disabilities (EBD), yet little is known about teachers’ momentary affective experiences. In this study, we collected 710 surveys regarding momentary affect from 14 teachers of students with EBD. We used descriptive analysis and variance decomposition to examine the frequency, intensity, and variability of these experiences. We then tested a series of models to explore how specific professional activities relate to teachers’ momentary affect. We found that teachers experienced positive affect more frequently and intensely than negative affect and that large proportions of the variation in positive and negative affect can be attributed to variation within individual teachers across time points. For these teachers, engaging in discipline was significantly associated with a higher negative affect, whereas engaging in …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Leveraging working conditions to improve the quality and effectiveness of the special education teacher workforce,"Students with disabilities depend on special education teachers (SETs) to provide skilled, intensive intervention; SETs depend on working conditions that facilitate their capacity to fulfill this charge. In this chapter, we describe mechanisms by which working conditions affect the capacity of the SET workforce to fulfill their responsibilities, and thereby affect educational systems’ capacity to fulfill commitments to students with disabilities. We discuss how working conditions contribute to SETs’ experiences and outcomes (e.g., instruction, attrition). We then consider how working conditions affect the capacity of educational systems (i.e., school, district, state, national) to meet their obligations to students by affecting the size, composition, and distribution of the SET workforce. Finally, we draw conclusions for policy makers, leaders, teachers, and researchers.",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Observation studies in special education: A synthesis of validity evidence for observation systems,"Classroom observation research plays an important role in policy, practice, and scholarship for students with disabilities. When interpreting results of observation studies, it is important to consider the validity evidence provided by researchers and how that speaks to the intended use of those results. In this literature synthesis, we used Kane’s argument-based approach to validity to describe evidence of validity for uses of observation instruments in classroom observation research regarding teachers of students with disabilities. We identified 102 studies from 1975 to 2020 that met inclusion criteria. Results indicated many studies did not report validity evidence to support their use of the observation instruments. Over time, reporting levels for much of the evidence has remained relatively constant, but we noted a consistent decrease in number of observations conducted per teacher and a consistent and large increase …",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Factors shaping the special education teacher workforce,"Unites States educational systems have consistently failed to cultivate a SET workforce of sufficient size, equitably distributed across schools, to provide effective services for all students with disabilities1 (Bettini, Scott et al., this text). The current SET workforce is (1) too small and insufficiently diverse (a composition problem);(2) inequitably distributed across schools, such that the most experienced, qualified, and effective personnel disproportionately teach in schools serving the most socioculturally privileged students (a distribution problem); and (3) insufficiently effective at promoting positive outcomes among students with disabilities (an effectiveness problem; Bettini, Scott et al., this text). Addressing these challenges will require coordination among federal and state education agencies, teacher preparation programs (TPPs), districts, and schools (Brownell et al., 2010). These institutions are interdependent: state education agencies set licensure standards that incentivize educators to obtain key skills (Sindelar et al., 2019); TPPs prepare candidates with these skills (Leko et al., 2015); districts allocate personnel and provide professional development to foster their skills (Billingsley et al., 2009); and schools provide working conditions that shape their ability to effectively serve students (Bettini et al., 2016). Further, these institutions are situated in the broader sociohistorical context of the US, where educational institutions hold potential to promote equity, but often reinforce hierarchies based on racism, ableism, classism, and other systems of oppression (Starck et al., 2020). As shown in our Conceptual Framework (Figure 1), these organizations and …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Gendered discourse about special education teaching as care work: Implications for improving inequitable working conditions,"Unsustainable working conditions are harmful to special educators and students, yet they are normalized in schools. Popular discourse valorizes a willingness to overwork and sacrifice one’s own well-being as a laudable attribute of “good teachers.” We argue that working conditions underlie the expectation that special educators should overwork, and that teachers’ working conditions reflect society’s investments in the students who they serve; inequities in teachers’ working conditions based on students’ ability, race/ethnicity, and class reflect inequitable investments in students with disabilities, students of color, students living in poor communities, and students with multiple marginalized identity markers. We contend that Discourse about teaching as gendered care work–as the natural work of maternal, caring women–serves to absolve society of responsibility for eliminating these inequities, instead devolving that responsibility onto individual teachers who are expected to sacrifice their own well-being to compensate for social disinvestment in their students’ lives. Thus, we contend that the gendered Discourse about teaching, especially special education teaching, is entangled with ableism, racism, and classism, and serves to deflect responsibility for addressing inequities away from those with capacity to change them (eg, leaders, policymakers).",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,No child left behind and the individuals with disabilities education act: examining special educators’ outcomes,"Drawing on eight waves of the Schools and Staffing Survey and the National Teacher and Principal Survey, we used a difference-in-differences research design to examine special education teachers’ (SETs) responses to No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the subsequent reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA was associated with decreases in the proportion of SETs with special education as a field of study and graduate degrees, an increase in co-teaching, and a decrease in the proportion of SETs working in a resource delivery model, with no evidence that NCLB influenced these outcomes. Little consistent evidence was found to indicate these federal policies influenced SETs’ job attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction). We identified differences in these associations based on school poverty status and grade level. These findings help to better understand the status and challenges of …",2024
ELIZABETH BETTINI,US middle and high school teacher attributions of externalizing student behavior,"Teachers’ attributions of student behavior are associated with the decisions they make about how to respond to behavior problems and support their students. This exploratory study investigates teachers’ attributions of student externalizing behavior, how attributions vary as a function of teacher and school characteristics, and the association of those attributions with teachers’ perceived likelihood of referring students to mental health services or implementing punitive discipline. We provided a sample of U.S. secondary school teachers (N = 426) a vignette depicting a student with oppositional defiant disorder and asked them to describe what was happening with the student. Attributions were categorized as internal to the student (e.g., mental health), external (e.g., problems at home), both (internal and external), and neutral (e.g., “normal teen behavior”). Results indicated the majority of teachers attributed vignette …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Comparing teacher turnover intentions to actual turnover: Cautions and lessons for the field,"Many studies rely on teachers’ reported career intentions instead of measuring actual turnover, but research does not clearly document how these variables relate to one another. We test how measures of teacher intentions relate to turnover. Using nationally representative data on 102,970 public school teachers, we conduct a descriptive and regression analysis to probe how teachers’ turnover intentions are and are not associated with moving schools and leaving teaching. While there is some variation across measures of intent, we find evidence that intention is distinct from, but strongly related to, turnover. We advise that surveys continue to capture intention as it provides meaningful information, but we recommend intention not be used as proxy for turnover.",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Untying the double bind,"Racially and ethnically minoritized students are now the majority in U.S. public schools. This demographic change, along with heightened attention to racial injustice and evidence regarding the importance of Black teachers, has renewed a decades-old push to increase their numbers. Redesigning teacher education and development to support the recruitment and retention of Black teachers requires ongoing critical understanding of their racialized experiences. Uncritical approaches to workplace diversification perpetuate deficit attitudes toward Black students and unfairly burden Black teachers. Authors Christopher J. Cormier, Elizabeth Bettini, and Kristabel Stark describe challenges novice Black teachers often face, and they suggest critical considerations for this conversation within teacher education programs and schools.",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Conceptual frameworks for understanding special educators' decisions to stay or leave,"US schools have never had enough special education teachers (SETs) to serve all students with disabilities, in part due to high SET attrition rates. As such, researchers have long sought to understand why SETs leave, but they have often done so without grounding their analyses in clear conceptual frameworks. Conceptual frameworks help scholars build schemas for understanding a problem; in doing so, they point out potential directions for future inquiry, directing scholars' attention toward new ways of conceptualizing a problem. Efforts to research and improve SET retention thus require strong conceptual foundations, supported by robust research, to understand why SETs leave and stay. Therefore, in this chapter, we describe conceptual frameworks that researchers have used to study SET attrition and retention. We first present an overview of the frameworks used in prior research, and second, consider some of …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Examining Relationships Between Field Placements and Preservice Teachers’ Self-Efficacy and Career Plans,"Field placements are arguably the most crucial component of traditional preservice special education teacher preparation. In field placements, cooperating teachers and university supervisors foster preservice special educators’ sense of efficacy to teach, supporting their investment in continuing in the profession. Although ample research indicates the importance of cooperating teachers for preservice teachers’ outcomes, little of this research has been conducted with preservice special educators. Moreover, prior research has almost never focused on university supervisors, despite their critical role bridging the relationship between content learned in coursework and the applied practice of special education within placement schools. In this investigation, we examined how preservice special educators’ experiences of support from cooperating teachers and university supervisors relate to their teacher self-efficacy …",2024
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Special Education Teachers' Social Contexts: Implications for Sustaining Teachers in Schools,"Positive social contexts are important to special education teachers' (SETs) sense of relatedness in schools and their collaborative work with others as they plan, deliver, and assess their students' learning. Quantitative research results suggest a strong relationship between SETs' social supports and their job satisfaction and retention; however, far less attention has been focused on what is meant by social support in SETs' day-to-day work. In this chapter, we reviewed 26 qualitative research studies over a 20-year period to better understand SETs' positive and problematic experiences with leaders, colleagues, and paraprofessionals (paras), using their own words when available. We drew from the new SET literature, the attrition/retention literature, and literature focused on SETs of color, as they are underrepresented in schools and important to the achievement of students. We focused on both the source of support …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Promises and limitations of financial incentives to address special education staffing challenges,"Nationwide, schools struggle to fill special education teacher positions, raising concerns about whether schools are adequately staffed to meet the needs of students with disabilities. At the start of the 2023-24 school year, nearly all states reported a large number of unfilled special education teacher positions, and current studies of job postings also show that special educator positions remain open longer, with fewer applicants. Special education teacher staffing challenges pose a serious problem for schools, which are required by federal law to provide students who are eligible for special education with additional instructional services, from a licensed special education teacher. When positions go unfilled, students are less likely to receive services from a qualified teacher, or worse, not receive special education services at all.",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Comparing Turnover Intentions and Actual Turnover in the Public Sector Workforce,"Many studies rely on public sector employees’ reported career intentions instead of measuring actual turnover, but research does not clearly document how these variables relate to one another. We develop and test three ways in which measures of employee intentions and turnover might relate to one another:(a) intention may measure the same underlying construct as turnover;(b) intention may be distinct from but strongly related to turnover; or (c) intentions may be distinct from turnover. Using nationally representative data on 102,970 public school teachers, we conduct a descriptive and regression analysis to probe how teachers’ turnover intentions are and are not associated with attrition. While there is some variation across measures of intent, we find evidence most consistent with the second scenario; intention is distinct from, but strongly related to, turnover. We offer recommendations for how researchers should use public sector employee intentions in research.",2022
ELIZABETH BETTINI,Examining the Supply of New Special Educators: Variations by Institutional Characteristics and For-Profit Status,"U.S. schools have long experienced shortages of special education teachers (SETs), challenging the nation’s capacity to ensure qualified SETs for students eligible for special education services. Addressing SET shortages requires preparation programs supply sufficient numbers of new SETs to meet demand, yet prior research provides few insights into trends in the supply of new SETs. Thus, we examined how the supply of new SETs changed over time in relation to the characteristics of teacher preparation programs. We find decreasing supply of new SETs nationally, primarily driven by reduced supply of new SETs from small colleges. Results suggest the current SET shortage may be connected, in previously undocumented ways, to the broader decline of small- and mid-sized colleges. Finally, findings indicate the nation may be far more dependent on for-profit institutions for supplying new SETs, which has …",2024

ELIZABETH BETTINI,Relationships between Organizational Factors and Teachers’ Knowledge and Use of Culturally Relevant Education,"Culturally relevant education (CRE) is a powerful tool for improving students’ educational experiences and outcomes. Yet CRE is not the norm in U.S. public education systems (Achinstein & Ogawa, 2011, 2012; Borrero et al., 2016; Coffey & Farinde-Wu, 2016), perhaps because teachers are socialized into systems that reproduce and uphold white-normed practice (Leonardo & Manning, 2017). The organizational contexts and conditions surrounding teachers’ practice could be a tool for leaders and policy makers to promote the use of CRE in schools.The purpose of this study was to explore how three organizational factors—administrative support, school culture, and curricula—may contribute to teachers’ knowledge and enactment of CRE. We framed our analysis using cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) (Cole & Engeström, 1993), a tool for examining how learning is situated in …",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,"The Impact of a $10,000 Bonus on Special Education Teacher Shortages in Hawai'i. Working Paper No. 290-0823.","We study the impact of a bonus policy implemented by Hawai'i Public Schools starting in fall 2020 that raised the salaries of all special education teachers in the state by $10,000. We estimate that the introduction of this policy reduced the proportion of vacant special education teaching positions by 32%, or 1.2 percentage points, and the proportion of special education positions that were vacant or filled by an unlicensed teacher by 35%, or 4.0 percentage points. The bonus policy did not have significant impacts on special education teacher retention; instead, the impacts of the policy were driven almost entirely by an increase in the number of general education teachers in the state who moved into open special education teaching positions. The effects of the bonus policy were also largest in historically hard-to-staff schools in which all teachers also received ""tiered school"" bonuses of up to $8,000. Hawai'i therefore represents a unique but instructive case of how",2023
ELIZABETH BETTINI,A Descriptive Portrait of the Paraeducator Workforce in Washington State. Working Paper No. 283-0423.,"We use over 25 years of longitudinal data from Washington state to provide a descriptive portrait of the paraeducator workforce in the state. Paraeducators are more racially and ethnically diverse than special education teachers, particularly in the last decade, and tend to be less experienced. They also have full-time salaries that are about half of the average special education teacher salary. Paraeducator-to-student ratios have decreased over time in the state, but they are higher in schools serving more students of color. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, paraeducator attrition rates from the state's public school workforce have increased dramatically over time; for example, the paraeducator attrition rate after the 2021-22 school year (23%) was over twice as high as the attrition rate after the 2008-09 school year (8%). These findings have implications for how policymakers and school leaders should approach decision-making related to the paraeducator workforce, as well as",2023

ADRIAN WHITTY,High accuracy prediction of PROTAC complex structures,"The design of PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) requires bringing an E3 ligase into proximity with a target protein to modulate the concentration of the latter through its ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we present a method for generating high-accuracy structural models of E3 ligase–PROTAC–target protein ternary complexes. The method is dependent on two computational innovations: adding a “silent” convolution term to an efficient protein–protein docking program to eliminate protein poses that do not have acceptable linker conformations and clustering models of multiple PROTACs that use the same E3 ligase and target the same protein. Results show that the largest consensus clusters always have high predictive accuracy and that the ensemble of models can be used to predict the dissociation rate and cooperativity of the ternary complex that relate to the degrading activity of the PROTAC …",2023
ADRIAN WHITTY,Conformational effects on the passive membrane permeability of synthetic macrocycles,"Macrocyclic compounds (MCs) can have complex conformational properties that affect pharmacologically important behaviors such as membrane permeability. We measured the passive permeability of 3600 diverse nonpeptidic MCs and used machine learning to analyze the results. Incorporating selected properties based on the three-dimensional (3D) conformation gave models that predicted permeability with Q2 = 0.81. A biased spatial distribution of polar versus nonpolar regions was particularly important for good permeability, consistent with a mechanism in which the initial insertion of nonpolar portions of a MC helps facilitate the subsequent membrane entry of more polar parts. We also examined effects on permeability of 800 substructural elements by comparing matched molecular pairs. Some substitutions were invariably beneficial or invariably deleterious to permeability, while the influence of others was …",2022
ADRIAN WHITTY,The anti-Müllerian hormone prodomain is displaced from the hormone/prodomain complex upon bivalent binding to the hormone receptor,"Noncovalent complexes of transforming growth factor-β family growth/differentiation factors with their prodomains are classified as latent or active, depending on whether the complexes can bind their respective receptors. For the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), the hormone–prodomain complex is active, and the prodomain is displaced upon binding to its type II receptor, AMH receptor type-2 (AMHR2), on the cell surface. However, the mechanism by which this displacement occurs is unclear. Here, we used ELISA assays to measure the dependence of prodomain displacement on AMH concentration and analyzed results with respect to the behavior expected for reversible binding in combination with ligand-induced receptor dimerization. We found that, in solution, the prodomain has a high affinity for the growth factor (GF) (Kd = 0.4 pM). Binding of the AMH complex to a single AMHR2 molecule does not affect this Kd …",2022
ADRIAN WHITTY,MEnTaT: A machine-learning approach for the identification of mutations to increase protein stability,"Enhancing protein thermal stability is important for biomedical and industrial applications as well as in the research laboratory. Here, we describe a simple machine-learning method which identifies amino acid substitutions that contribute to thermal stability based on comparison of the amino acid sequences of homologous proteins derived from bacteria that grow at different temperatures. A key feature of the method is that it compares the sequences based not simply on the amino acid identity, but rather on the structural and physicochemical properties of the side chain. The method accurately identified stabilizing substitutions in three well-studied systems and was validated prospectively by experimentally testing predicted stabilizing substitutions in a polyamine oxidase. In each case, the method outperformed the widely used bioinformatic consensus approach. The method can also provide insight into fundamental …",2023
ADRIAN WHITTY,A conserved core region of the scaffold NEMO is essential for signal-induced conformational change and liquid-liquid phase separation,"Scaffold proteins help mediate interactions between protein partners, often to optimize intracellular signaling. Herein, we use comparative, biochemical, biophysical, molecular, and cellular approaches to investigate how the scaffold protein NEMO contributes to signaling in the NF-κB pathway. Comparison of NEMO and the related protein optineurin from a variety of evolutionarily distant organisms revealed that a central region of NEMO, called the Intervening Domain (IVD), is conserved between NEMO and optineurin. Previous studies have shown that this central core region of the IVD is required for cytokine-induced activation of IκB kinase (IKK). We show that the analogous region of optineurin can functionally replace the core region of the NEMO IVD. We also show that an intact IVD is required for the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of NEMO. Moreover, inactivating mutations in this core region abrogate the …",2023

KAREN JACOBSON,Climate change and urban migration in sub-saharan African cities: impacts and governance challenges,"Urban informal settlements are rapidly expanding in countries around the world. This is due partly to high birth rates, but also because of growing in-migration driven by climate change impacts affecting rural populations. Urban informal settlements struggle with degraded and sometimes nonexistent infrastructure (such as water, sewage, and drainage systems) and service provision (health, education), and these shortcomings are aggravated by urban climate-related hazards like flooding and heat spikes. As informal settlements expand, their already overburdened infrastructure can lead to urban disasters such as flooding and landfill collapse. These challenges increase the governance and financial problems already faced by cities and create significant problems for climate resilience planning processes. Policy responses at both the national and city levels promise much but deliver little. This article reviews …",2023
KAREN JACOBSON,Introduction to the Handbook on Forced Migration: A critical take on forced migration today,"Books about forced migration usually begin with the numbers, and at the end of 2022, those numbers are astonishing. Globally, for the first time, the number of people who have been forcibly displaced exceeds 100 million people–one in every 78 people on earth. 1 This global figure encompasses the dramatic displacement events that have occurred over the past five years: the war in Syria and the resulting 2016–18 European “migration crisis”; 2 the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Venezuela; the August 2021 evacuation from Afghanistan, and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia (which at this writing, October 2022, has displaced more than 12 million Ukrainians3). These numbers include only those people displaced by conflict and persecution; they do not include the millions who have been displaced by weather and climate-related disasters, or by the loss of livelihoods from the long-term impact of climate …",2023
KAREN JACOBSON,"Urban policy responses to climate hazards in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Urban in-migration, high birth rates and unchecked development are driving the continued growth of African cities. Much of this urbanization occurs in informal settlements, where unplanned growth exacerbates the impacts of climate hazards. Our paper explores the challenges faced by urban planners seeking to address climate change threats in African cities. Focusing on Addis Ababa, we conduct a robust policy analysis of urban government response. Our main finding is that Addis Ababa’s environmental challenges are primarily a result of urban development and inadequate planning and policy enforcement. Environmental challenges are exacerbated by rapidly intensifying climate impacts, but not driven by them. Improved city-level policy responses can potentially mitigate many of Addis Ababa’s current environmental challenges and prepare the city to weather future ones. We highlight four areas of policy …",2024
KAREN JACOBSON,Conclusion: A call for ethical standards in forced migration research,"Our Handbook started with history and ends with the future, and the ongoing need to be conscious of so-called “solutions” and their intended and unintended results. Forced migration is “a device to read social change” 1 and this Handbook sought to disrupt and interrogate dominant narratives by including a diversity of voices and perspectives. Our contributors included both seasoned writers and people just starting their careers, and the voices of policy makers, practitioners and forced migrants, and academics. We editors do not necessarily agree wholeheartedly with all the ideas and perspectives presented here. We deliberately chose to withhold our own views (with their attendant biases), and to let authors speak their minds. Our biggest editorial challenge was to identify authors who live and work in the countries most affected by forced migration. We wanted to change the predominant European and US-centric …",2023
KAREN JACOBSON,Climate mobility and accountability,"Human mobility in the context of environmental change has been on the global policy agenda since 1992. Two parallel processes have emerged: one from climate-related organizations beginning with the Earth Summit in 1992 then proceeding with the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC); 1 and the other from migration-related ones, most recently via the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM). 2The climate-related process began when the Earth Summit adopted the Rio Declaration, which pointed out that “policies and programmes should be developed for handling the various types of migrations that result from or induce environmental disruptions, with special attention to women and vulnerable groups”. 3 The COP first addressed human mobility in discussions under the 2007 Bali Action Plan. In 2010, the COP adopted the …",2023

SUSAN WALKER,Perceived stress during the prenatal period: assessing measurement invariance of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) across cultures and birth parity,"Maternal prenatal stress places a substantial burden on mother’s mental health. Expectant mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have thus far received less attention than mothers in high-income settings. This is particularly problematic, as a range of triggers, such as exposure to traumatic events (e.g. natural disasters, previous pregnancy losses) and adverse life circumstances (e.g. poverty, community violence), put mothers at increased risk of experiencing prenatal stress. The ten-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is a widely recognised index of subjective experience of stress that is increasingly used in LMICs. However, evidence for its measurement equivalence across settings is lacking. This study aims to assess measurement invariance of the PSS-10 across eight LMICs and across birth parity.

Establishing the psychometric comparability of scores across countries also facilitates analyses of similarities and differences across contexts. To date, however, few studies have evaluated the psychometric properties and comparability of the most widely used antenatal depressive symptom measures across diverse cultural, political, and social contexts. To address this gap, we used data from the Evidence for Better Lives Study—Foundational Research (EBLS-FR) project to examine the internal consistency reliability, nomological network validity, and cross-country measurement invariance of the nine-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) in antenatal samples across eight low …",2022

SUSAN WALKER,Early childhood interventions: issues to consider in getting to scale,"In the 1930s, one of the earliest studies to demonstrate the importance of the environment for child development showed that when institutionalized children with low IQs were moved to an institution for “feeble minded women,” their IQs improved to the normal range. The apparent mechanism was that the women enjoyed interacting with the children. However, the findings were strongly contested by eugenicists. 1There is now overwhelming evidence that poverty and associated factors in early childhood affect children’s development. Key factors include poor growth, unstimulating home environments, low parental education, and poor maternal mental health. 2–4 Deficits in development are evident from the first year of life and increase at least up to age 6 years. 2, 5",2023

SUSAN WALKER,Using lessons learnt from key stakeholders to increase support for scaling the Reach Up Early Childhood Parenting program,"Sustainable implementation of early childhood programs requires resources, materials and methods that are adaptable, scalable and feasible for delivery through multiple sectors. Additional or modified program resources may be required to meet emerging needs, as programs go to scale. An active and effective monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) process may enable programs to be responsive to demands. The Reach Up: Early Childhood Parenting program, is designed primarily for disadvantaged children under 4 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to promote their development through playful caregiver interactions. The curriculum, training manuals and other materials and resources support implementers in the adaptation of the intervention, implementation, workforce training, monitoring and evaluation. This paper reports on how data collected from key informants drove modifications to program processes, materials and resources.We conducted in-depth interviews with 14 key informants (including program managers, lead trainers, academics, consultants and workforce personnel) on their experiences with Reach Up across 15 LMICs  where the program has been implemented.  We also reviewed written records generated from (i) structured small group discussions at a Knowledge Exchange meeting of 31 Reach Up partners and (ii) notes from working groups formed at the meeting and tasked to continue working post-meeting to find solutions to support ongoing implementation.

SUSAN WALKER,"Theory, principles and key content of the Reach Up Curriculum","There is substantial research from high income countries and more recently from low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) showing that deficits in cognition and/or language are evident in poor children as early as the first year of life (1-3) and increase to school age, when the deficits are large (often over one standard deviation) and likely to affect children’s progress in school and subsequent life success. It has also been shown that compared with more affluent mothers, those living in poverty use fewer words with their children and offer less mediation of the environment by showing and describing objects and actions. These differences are related to poor language development in children (4). Poverty is also associated with changes in brain structure and function (5). It is estimated that poverty and associated risks lead to at least 43% of children under age 5 years in LMIC not attaining their developmental potential (1).The Reach Up: Early Childhood Parenting Programme is based on the curriculum developed for the Jamaica Home Visiting (JHV) intervention and is designed primarily for disadvantaged children up to 4 years of age in LMIC. The JHV curriculum was initially developed in the late 1960s, in response to observations that many children exposed to extreme poverty in Kingston, Jamaica were not reaching their developmental potential. The children lived in unstimulating environments with no toys or books and their mothers had little understanding of the importance of play and responsive interactions.

Feeding information was ascertained at 12 months by questionnaire with feeding styles identified using factor analysis. Children’s weight and length/height were measured at 18 and 72 months and BMI z-scores computed. Maternal sociodemographic data, depressive symptoms and language skills were obtained by questionnaire. Multilevel linear regression analysis was used to examine whether feeding styles predicted 72 month BMI z-scores. Complete case analysis was conducted and multiple imputation used to treat missing values of explanatory and outcome variables at 18 and 72 months. Mediational analysis was performed to assess the indirect effects of feeding styles on 72 month BMI z-scores via 18 month BMI z-scores.Restrictive feeding at age 12 months predicted higher 72 month BMI z-scores in both complete case analysis [β (95%CI): 0.19 (0.02, 0.37)] and multiple imputation [β (95%CI): 0.20 (0.02, 0.39)].

This implementation of partial denitrification–anammox (PdNA) in deep bed filters at the HRSD York River treatment plant was demonstrated to achieve the benefits of shortcut nitrogen removal without nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) out‐selection. The transition from denitrification to PdNA filters required bleeding ammonium to the filters using an optimized ammonium versus NOx (AvN) control in the upstream aeration tanks and maintaining a nitrate residual in the filter effluent through feedforward/feedback control. The latter actions led to savings of 85% in methanol, 100% in alkalinity, and 35% in capacity enhancement.

The surface roughness and iron content of the expanded clay were hypothesized to allow for enhanced anammox retention, nitrogen removal rates, and runtimes. However, under the tested loading rates and backwash conditions, no clear benefit of expanded clay was observed compared with conventional sand. This study showed the feasibility of PdNA in filters with both sand and expanded clay with PdN efficiencies of 76% and 77%, PdNA rates of 840 and 843 g N/m3/d and TIN removal rates of 960 and 964 g N/m3/d, respectively.

Therefore, demonstrating the reliability and robustness of PdNA in polishing filters will advance its full-scale applications. In this study, methanol and glycerol were used as carbon sources with carbon demands of 2.05 and 2.54 g CODadded g TINremoved−1, and showed up to 80% TIN removal through the anammox pathway, leading to potential carbon savings of up to 65% compared to conventional denitrification filters. The higher partial denitrification efficiency (67% ± 12% vs. 59% ± 12%) and PdNA rate (437 ± 213 vs. 397 ± 205 g N m−3 d−1) of glycerol did not compensate for its higher biomass yield and cost (currently in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States), thus making methanol the preferred carbon source.

KIMBERLY HOWARD,Media selection for anammox‐based polishing filters: Balancing anammox enrichment and retention with filtration function,"Retrofitting conventional denitrification filters into partial denitrification‐anammox (PdNA)‐ or anammox (AnAOB)‐based filters will reduce the needs for external carbon addition. The success of AnAOB‐based filters depends on anammox growth and retention within such filters. Studies have overlooked the importance of media selection and its impact on AnAOB capacity, head loss progression dynamics, and shear conditions applied onto the AnAOB biofilm. The objective of this study was to evaluate viable media types (10 types) that can enhance AnAOB rates for efficient nitrogen removal in filters. Given the higher backwash requirement and lower AnAOB capacity of the conventionally used sand, expanded clay (3–5 mm) was recommended for AnAOB‐based filters in this study. Owing to its surface characteristics, expanded clay had higher AnAOB activity (304‐ vs. 104‐g NH4+‐N/m2/day) and higher AnAOB …",2022

KIMBERLY HOWARD,"Media selection for anammox‐based polishing filters: Balancing anammox enrichment and retention with filtration function [Erratum: June 2022, v. 94 (6); p. e10753]","Retrofitting conventional denitrification filters into partial denitrification‐anammox (PdNA)‐ or anammox (AnAOB)‐based filters will reduce the needs for external carbon addition. The success of AnAOB‐based filters depends on anammox growth and retention within such filters. Studies have overlooked the importance of media selection and its impact on AnAOB capacity, head loss progression dynamics, and shear conditions applied onto the AnAOB biofilm. The objective of this study was to evaluate viable media types (10 types) that can enhance AnAOB rates for efficient nitrogen removal in filters. Given the higher backwash requirement and lower AnAOB capacity of the conventionally used sand, expanded clay (3–5 mm) was recommended for AnAOB‐based filters in this study. Owing to its surface characteristics, expanded clay had higher AnAOB activity (304‐ vs. 104‐g NH₄⁺‐N/m²/day) and higher AnAOB retention (43% more) than sand. Increasing the iron content of expanded clay to 37% resulted in an increase in zeta potential, which led to 56% more anammox capacity compared to expanded clay with 7% iron content. This work provides insight into the importance of media types in the growth and retention of AnAOB in filters, and this knowledge could be used as basis in the development of PdNA filters. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Expanded clay showed the lowest head loss buildup and most likely will result in longer runtime for full‐scale PdNA applications The highest AnAOB rates were achieved in expanded clay types and sand compared with smaller media typically used in biofiltration Expanded clay resulted in better AnAOB retention …",2022
NEIL MYLER,Argument structure and morphology in Cochabamba Quechua (with occasional comparison with other Quechua varieties),"Data from Quechua languages have played an important role in a number of theoretical debates in linguistics. Ever since Pieter Muysken’s seminal work on Quechua word-structure starting in the late 1970s and running throughout the 1980s, valency-changing morphology in the language family has been especially prominent in debates connected to the relationship between morphology, syntax, and semantics. Indeed, Muysken’s analyses of the interactions of causatives, reflexives, and reciprocals were crucial sources for Baker  in his proposal of the Mirror Principle. In the decades since, numerous discussions of Quechua morphology have appeared, both from lexicalist and syntacticist standpoints, and there have been huge developments in the theoretical literature on argument structure and morphology. A reassessment of valency-changing morphology in Quechua is therefore long overdue. This chapter aims …",2023
NEIL MYLER,Accounting for the Mirror Principle and its exceptions in causative-applicative interactions: The case of isiXhosa,"Causative-Applicative interactions in the Southern Bantu language isiXhosa exhibit paradoxical behavior with regard to the Mirror Principle (Baker 1985), in some cases seeming to strongly support it, but in others appearing to violate it. We motivate a three-way taxonomy of Applicatives in isiXhosa: Low Applicatives, High Applicatives, and Super High Applicatives. The Causative must follow Low Appl, must precede Super High Appl, and may either precede or follow High Appl. We propose an adaptation of the raising analysis of High Applicatives (Georgala 2012; Paul & Whitman 2010, Nie 2019), according to which High Applicatives are not (in all cases) theta-positions, but instead licensors of oblique arguments whose thematic roles come from elsewhere. We show that this approach makes strong predictions about the sorts of apparent Mirror Principle violation involving Causatives and Applicatives that can occur, including:(i) only High Appl can participate in such violations, not Low Appl;(ii) only Caus-Appl can give rise to apparent Mirror Principle violations; Appl-Caus orders never can. We argue that these predictions are correct.",2024
NEIL MYLER,Sintaxis,"La sintaxis es la parte de la lingüística que se enfoca en las reglas que rigen la estructura de las frases y de las oraciones. El orden de los elementos de la frase forma parte de la sintaxis. Sin embargo, la sintaxis involucra mucho más que el orden de las palabras. Cuando estudiamos sintaxis, nos fijamos mayormente en la estructura jerárquica en que se combinan los elementos básicos de la oración, y en las relaciones que existen entre estos. Resulta que las palabras no se combinan como las cuentas de un rosario, una tras otra. En realidad, en cualquier oración, y en cualquier idioma, hay elementos que se relacionan entre sí unos más estrechamente que con otros. En muchos casos, estas relaciones más estrechas son obvias. Describir bien la sintaxis de un idioma consiste, en gran parte, en el desarrollo y la aplicación de tales pruebas de diagnóstico. Además, entender los principios universales de la sintaxis en la mente humana, lo que es la meta final de la teoría sintáctica, requiere descripciones buenas de muchos idiomas de diversos tipos.

MATTHEW STEWART,Asbestos and Iron,"Theories of disease pathogenesis following asbestos exposure have focused on the participation of iron. After exposure, an open network of negatively charged functional groups on the fiber surface complexes host metals with a preference for iron. Competition for iron between the host and the asbestos results in a functional metal deficiency. The homeostasis of iron in the host is modified by the cell response, including increased import to correct the loss of the metal to the fiber surface. The biological effects of asbestos develop in response to and are associated with the disruption of iron homeostasis. Cell iron deficiency in the host following fiber exposure activates kinases and transcription factors, which are associated with the release of mediators coordinating both inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Relative to serpentine chrysotile, the clearance of amphiboles is incomplete, resulting in translocation to the mesothelial surface of the pleura. Since the biological effect of asbestos is dependent on retention of the fiber, the sequestration of iron by the surface, and functional iron deficiency in the cell, the greater clearance (i.e., decreased persistence) of chrysotile results in its diminished impact. An inability to clear asbestos from the lower respiratory tract initiates a host process of iron biomineralization (i.e., asbestos body formation). Host cells attempt to mobilize the metal sequestered by the fiber surface by producing superoxide at the phagosome membrane. The subsequent ferrous cation is oxidized and undergoes hydrolysis, creating poorly crystalline iron oxyhydroxide (i.e., ferrihydrite) included in the coat of the asbestos body.",2023
MATTHEW STEWART,NeuroBench: A Framework for Benchmarking Neuromorphic Computing Algorithms and Systems,"Neuromorphic computing shows promise for advancing computing efficiency and capabilities of AI applications using brain-inspired principles. However, the neuromorphic research field currently lacks standardized benchmarks, making it difficult to accurately measure technological advancements, compare performance with conventional methods, and identify promising future research directions. Prior neuromorphic computing benchmark efforts have not seen widespread adoption due to a lack of inclusive, actionable, and iterative benchmark design and guidelines. To address these shortcomings, we present NeuroBench: a benchmark framework for neuromorphic computing algorithms and systems. NeuroBench is a collaboratively-designed effort from an open community of nearly 100 co-authors across over 50 institutions in industry and academia, aiming to provide a representative structure for standardizing the evaluation of neuromorphic approaches. The NeuroBench framework introduces a common set of tools and systematic methodology for inclusive benchmark measurement, delivering an objective reference framework for quantifying neuromorphic approaches in both hardware-independent (algorithm track) and hardware-dependent (system track) settings. In this article, we present initial performance baselines across various model architectures on the algorithm track and outline the system track benchmark tasks and guidelines. NeuroBench is intended to continually expand its benchmarks and features to foster and track the progress made by the research community.",2023

This paper introduces a standard datasheet template for ML sensors and discusses its essential components including: the system's hardware, ML model and dataset attributes, end-to-end performance metrics, and environmental impact. We provide an example datasheet for our own ML sensor and discuss each section in detail. We highlight how these datasheets can facilitate better understanding and utilization of sensor data in ML applications, and we provide objective measures upon which system performance can be evaluated and compared. Together, ML sensors and their datasheets provide greater privacy, security, transparency, explainability, auditability, and user-friendliness for ML-enabled embedded systems. We conclude by emphasizing the need for standardization of datasheets across the broader ML community to ensure the responsible and effective use of sensor data.",2023
MATTHEW STEWART,Materiality and Risk in the Age of Pervasive AI Sensors,"Artificial intelligence systems connected to sensor-laden devices are becoming pervasive, which has significant implications for a range of AI risks, including to privacy, the environment, autonomy, and more. There is therefore a growing need for increased accountability around the responsible development and deployment of these technologies. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of sensors, the risks they pose by virtue of their material existence in the world, and the impacts of ubiquitous sensing and on-device AI. We propose incorporating sensors into risk management frameworks and call for more responsible sensor and system design paradigms that address risks of such systems. To do so, we trace the evolution of sensors from analog devices to intelligent, networked systems capable of real-time data analysis and decision-making at the extreme edge of the network. We show that the proliferation of sensors is driven by calculative models that prioritize data collection and cost reduction and produce risks that emerge around privacy, surveillance, waste, and power dynamics. We then analyze these risks, highlighting issues of validity, safety, security, accountability, interpretability, and bias. We surface sensor-related risks not commonly captured in existing approaches to AI risk management, using a materiality lens that reveals how physical sensor properties shape data and algorithmic models. We conclude by advocating for increased attention to the materiality of algorithmic systems, and of on-device AI sensors in particular, and highlight the need for development of a responsible sensor design paradigm that …",2024

MATTHEW STEWART,"Wake Vision: A Large-scale, Diverse Dataset and Benchmark Suite for TinyML Person Detection","Machine learning applications on extremely low-power devices, commonly referred to as tiny machine learning (TinyML), promises a smarter and more connected world. However, the advancement of current TinyML research is hindered by the limited size and quality of pertinent datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Wake Vision, a large-scale, diverse dataset tailored for person detection -- the canonical task for TinyML visual sensing. Wake Vision comprises over 6 million images, which is a hundredfold increase compared to the previous standard, and has undergone thorough quality filtering. Using Wake Vision for training results in a 2.41\% increase in accuracy compared to the established benchmark. Alongside the dataset, we provide a collection of five detailed benchmark sets that assess model performance on specific segments of the test data, such as varying lighting conditions, distances from the camera, and demographic characteristics of subjects. These novel fine-grained benchmarks facilitate the evaluation of model quality in challenging real-world scenarios that are often ignored when focusing solely on overall accuracy. Through an evaluation of a MobileNetV2 TinyML model on the benchmarks, we show that the input resolution plays a more crucial role than the model width in detecting distant subjects and that the impact of quantization on model robustness is minimal, thanks to the dataset quality. These findings underscore the importance of a detailed evaluation to identify essential factors for model development.

MATTHEW STEWART,Basal and inducible Osterix expression reflect equine mesenchymal progenitor cell osteogenic capacity,"Mesenchymal stem cells are characterized by their capacities for extensive proliferation through multiple passages and, classically, tri-lineage differentiation along osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages. This study was carried out to compare osteogenesis in equine bone marrow-, synovium- and adipose-derived cells, and to determine whether osteogenic capacity is reflected in the basal expression of the critical osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix.Bone marrow, synovium and adipose tissue was collected from six healthy 2-year-old horses. Cells were isolated from these sources and expanded through two passages. Basal expression of Runx2 and Osterix was assessed in undifferentiated third passage cells, along with their response to osteogenic culture conditions.Bone marrow-derived cells had significantly higher basal expression of Osterix, but not Runx2. In osteogenic medium, bone-marrow cells rapidly developed dense, multicellular aggregates that stained strongly for mineral and alkaline phosphatase activity. Synovial and adipose cell cultures showed far less matrix mineralization. Bone marrow cells significantly up-regulated alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression and enzymatic activity at 7 and 14 days. Alkaline phosphatase expression and activity were increased in adipose cultures after 14 days, although these values were less than in bone marrow cultures. There was no change in alkaline phosphatase in synovial cultures. In osteogenic medium, bone marrow cultures increased both Runx2 and Osterix mRNA expression significantly at 7 and 14 days.

Stance duration and longitudinal and vertical components of the GRF were determined for the limbs of clinically sound horses and limbs of horses with DDF tendinopathy. Separate Spearman correlation analyses were used to assess potential association within groups (combined left and right forelimbs of clinically sound horses, lamest limbs of horses with DDF tendinopathy, and contralateral limbs of horses with DDF tendinopathy) and with the set of kinetic variables. Analysis of variance on mean ranks of tied values was used to determine differences in kinetic variables between groups (PROC GLIMMIX) using the kinetic values of the clinically sound horses as the reference group.There were a total of 11 lame horses. Seven horses had bilateral forelimb lameness and four had unilateral lameness. Of the 11 horses, there were 15 DDF tendinopathies.

SAM LING,Arousal-based pupil modulation is dictated by luminance,"Pupillometry has become a standard measure for assessing arousal state. However, environmental factors such as luminance, a primary dictator of pupillary responses, often vary across studies. To what degree does luminance interact with arousal-driven pupillary changes? Here, we parametrically assessed luminance-driven pupillary responses across a wide-range of luminances, while concurrently manipulating cognitive arousal using auditory math problems of varying difficulty. At the group-level, our results revealed that the modulatory effect of cognitive arousal on pupil size interacts multiplicatively with luminance, with the largest effects occurring at low and mid-luminances. However, at the level of individuals, there were qualitatively distinct individual differences in the modulatory effect of cognitive arousal on luminance-driven pupillary responses. Our findings suggest that pupillometry as a measure for …",2022
SAM LING,Saturating nonlinearities of contrast response in human visual cortex,"Response nonlinearities are ubiquitous throughout the brain, especially within sensory cortices where changes in stimulus intensity typically produce compressed responses. Although this relationship is well established in electrophysiological measurements, it remains controversial whether the same nonlinearities hold for population-based measurements obtained with human fMRI. We propose that these purported disparities are not contingent on measurement type and are instead largely dependent on the visual system state at the time of interrogation. We show that deploying a contrast adaptation paradigm permits reliable measurements of saturating sigmoidal contrast response functions (10 participants, 7 female). When not controlling the adaptation state, our results coincide with previous fMRI studies, yielding nonsaturating, largely linear contrast responses. These findings highlight the important role of …",2022
SAM LING,Feature-based attention multiplicatively scales the fMRI-BOLD contrast-response function,"fMRI plays a key role in the study of attention. However, there remains a puzzling discrepancy between attention effects measured with fMRI and with electrophysiological methods. While electrophysiological studies find that attention increases sensory gain, amplifying stimulus-evoked neural responses by multiplicatively scaling the contrast-response function (CRF), fMRI appears to be insensitive to these multiplicative effects. Instead, fMRI studies typically find that attention produces an additive baseline shift in the BOLD signal. These findings suggest that attentional effects measured with fMRI reflect top-down inputs to visual cortex, rather than the modulation of sensory gain. If true, this drastically limits what fMRI can tell us about how attention improves sensory coding. Here, we examined whether fMRI is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention using a feature-based attention paradigm designed to preclude …",2022
SAM LING,Attention preserves the selectivity of feature-tuned normalization,"Attention and divisive normalization both contribute to making visual processing more efficient. Attention selectively increases the neural gain of relevant information in the early visual cortex, resulting in stronger perceived salience for attended regions or features. Divisive normalization improves processing efficiency by suppressing responses to homogeneous inputs and highlighting salient boundaries, facilitating sparse coding of inputs. Theoretical and empirical research suggest a tight link between attention and normalization, wherein attending to a stimulus results in a release from normalization, thereby allowing for an increase in neural response gain. In the present study, we address whether attention alters the qualitative properties of normalization. Specifically, we examine how attention influences the feature-tuned nature of normalization, whereby suppression is stronger between visual stimuli whose …",2023
SAM LING,Evidence for a travel direction signal in humans that is independent of head direction,"We often assume that travel direction is redundant with head direction, but from first principles these two factors provide differing spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction, we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, we discovered a higher frequency of reporting perceived travel toward the adapted direction compared to a no-adapt control – an aftereffect that runs contrary to low-level motion aftereffects. This travel aftereffect was maintained after controlling for possible response biases and approaching effects, and it scaled with adaptation duration. These findings demonstrate the first evidence of how a pure travel direction signal might be represented in humans, independent of head direction.",2022
SAM LING,Davida reorients intermediate visual processing,"Vision is subserved by a hierarchical system, where increasingly complex representations are formed at each processing stage (Van Essen et al., 1992). This collection of interconnected brain regions is understood to work in concert to build a meaningful representation of our surroundings. Beginning with point-wise light detection by retinal ganglion cells, representations are pieced together in successive stages, forming scene segmentation and object representations. The earliest processing stages, involving the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus and early visual cortices, are thought to act as filters selective for various stimulus dimensions, giving rise to features such as orientation in areas LGN and V1 (Cheong et al., 2013; De Valois et al., 1982; Hubel & Wiesel, 1968). These early visual areas have been heavily studied and are understood to encode information about our surroundings in a retinotopic coordinate …",2022
SAM LING,The effects of emotional arousal on pupil size depend on luminance,"Pupillometry is widely used to measure arousal states. The primary functional role of the pupil, however, is to respond to the luminance of visual inputs. We previously demonstrated that cognitive effort-related arousal interacted multiplicatively with luminance, with the strongest pupillary effects of arousal occurring at low-to-mid luminances (< 37 cd/m2), implying a narrow range of conditions ideal for assessing cognitive arousal-driven pupillary differences. Does this generalize to other forms of arousal? To answer this, we assessed luminance-driven pupillary response functions while manipulating emotional arousal, using well-established visual and auditory stimulus sets. At the group level, emotional arousal interacted with the pupillary light response differently from cognitive arousal: the effects occurred primarily at much lower luminances (< 20 cd/m2). Analyses at the individual-participant level revealed …",2024
SAM LING,Are visual deficits in amblyopia driven by spatial frequency tuning?,"Amblyopia is characterized by visual deficits at high spatial frequencies. Prior work has demonstrated individuals with amblyopia have larger population receptive field (pRF) sizes in early visual areas, but how this increased RF size is linked to changes in spatial frequency tuning has yet to be determined. Model-based functional neuroimaging provides a method to map and interrogate how population spatial frequency tuning (pSFT) may differ in individuals with amblyopia. Here, we compared pSFT estimates to pRF maps in early visual cortex (V1–V3) in individuals with amblyopia and normally-sighted control participants. Monocular voxel-wise pRF and pSFT estimates were acquired in separate scanning sessions. We then compared pRF and pSFT estimates between eyes (amblyopic/non-dominant vs fellow/dominant eye) and between subject groups (amblyopia vs control). Across all individuals, RF size …",2024
SAM LING,Spatial Frequency Tuning in Early Visual Cortex is Not Scale Invariant,"The visual system can distinguish patterns over a wide variety of spatial scales. Based on physiological evidence, this robustness is thought to reflect the retinotopic scale-invariant organization of primary visual cortex, whereby the spatial area over which a cell responds is proportional to the spatial information that cell is tuned to convey. Specifically, larger receptive fields (RFs) when moving away from the foveal representation reflect the integration of information from increasingly larger regions of the visual field and a reduction in spatial sampling density. The assumption made by scale invariance is that the information sampled by a RF is constant across the visual field. Model-based fMRI methods, such as population receptive field (pRF) and population spatial frequency tuning (pSFT) analyses, have enabled the characterization of spatial tuning (eccentricity and size) and SF preferences (peak preference and …",2024

One way emotional arousal can influence vision is by altering spatial frequency (SF) processing, altering the scale of visual detail encoded by the visual system. Previous studies investigating the interaction between emotion and SF processing report an impairment in the processing of higher spatial frequencies (HSFs), while prioritizing lower spatial frequencies (LSFs) under fearful conditions (relative to a baseline or neutral condition). However, there is scant neural evidence supporting these changes in SF perception with emotion. To address this, we leveraged a population spatial frequency tuning mapping (pSFT) approach with fMRI to test how emotionally arousing auditory stimuli (Neutral vs. Negative) modulate SF processing in early visual cortex (V1 …",2024
SAM LING,Dynamic estimation of the attentional field from visual cortical activity,"Navigating around the world, we must adaptively allocate attention to our surroundings based on anticipated future stimuli and events. This allocation of spatial attention boosts visuocortical representations at attended locations and locally enhances perception. Indeed, spatial attention has often been analogized to a “spotlight” shining on the item of relevance. Although the neural underpinnings of the locus of this attentional spotlight have been relatively well studied, less is known about the size of the spotlight: to what extent can the attentional field be broadened and narrowed in accordance with behavioral demands? In this study, we developed a paradigm for dynamically estimating the locus and spread of covert spatial attention, inferred from visuocortical activity using fMRI in humans. We measured BOLD activity in response to an annulus while participants (4 female, 4 male) used covert visual attention to determine whether more numbers or letters were present in a cued region of the annulus. Importantly, the width of the cued area was systematically varied, calling for different sizes of the attentional spotlight. The deployment of attention was associated with an increase in BOLD activity in corresponding retinotopic regions of visual areas V1—V3. By modeling the visuocortical attentional modulation, we could reliably recover the cued location, as well as a broadening of the attentional enhancement with wider attentional cues. This modeling approach offers a useful window into the dynamics of attention and spatial uncertainty.This study explores whether spatial attention can dynamically adapt by shifting and …",2024
SAM LING,Pupil-linked arousal modulates precision of stimulus representation in cortex,"Neural responses are naturally variable from one moment to the next, even when the stimulus is held constant. What factors might underlie this variability in neural population activity? We hypothesized that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical stimulus representations are created by changes in arousal state. We tested the hypothesis using a combination of fMRI, probabilistic decoding methods, and pupillometry. Human participants (20 female, 12 male) were presented with gratings of random orientation. Shortly after viewing the grating, participants reported its orientation and gave their level of confidence in this judgment. Using a probabilistic fMRI decoding technique, we quantified the precision of the stimulus representation in the visual cortex on a trial-by-trial basis. Pupil size was recorded and analyzed to index the observer9s arousal state. We found that the precision of the cortical stimulus representation …",2024
SAM LING,Sensory Processing: Differential cortical and subcortical visual processing with eyes shut,"Closing our eyes largely shuts down our ability to see. That said, our eyelids still pass some light, allowing our visual system to coarsely process information about visual scenes, such as changes in luminance. However, the specific impact of eye closure on processing within the early visual system remains largely unknown. To understand how visual processing is modulated when eyes are shut, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure responses to a flickering visual stimulus at high (100%) and low (10%) temporal contrasts, while participants viewed the stimuli with their eyes open or closed. Interestingly, we discovered that eye closure produced a qualitatively distinct pattern of effects across the visual thalamus and visual cortex. We found that with eyes open, low temporal contrast stimuli produced smaller responses across the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), primary (V1) and …",2024

SAM LING,Is the loss of spatial resolution in amblyopia linked to a deviation in scale invariance?,"Purpose: The visual system's ability to identify patterns across various spatial scales is considered a result of the retinotopic scale-invariant organization of the early visual cortex. Individuals with amblyopia, however, experience deficits in spatial vision, potentially linked to larger receptive field (RF) sizes. The relation between RF size and spatial frequency preferences in individuals with amblyopia remains unclear. To address this gap, we employed model-based fMRI to comprehensively map how the retinotopic organization in the early visual cortex may contribute to spatial deficits observed in amblyopia.Methods: We compared population receptive field (pRF) and population spatial frequency tuning (pSFT) estimates in early visual cortex (V1–V3) in four individuals with amblyopia and eight normally-sighted control participants. Monocular voxel-wise pRF and pSFT estimates were acquired in separate scanning …",2024
SAM LING,(Don't) look where you are going: Evidence for a travel direction signal in humans that is independent of head direction.,"We often assume that travel direction is redundant with head direction, but from first principles, these two factors provide differing spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction, we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, we discovered a higher frequency of reporting perceived travel toward the adapted direction compared to a no-adapt control—an aftereffect that runs contrary to low-level motion aftereffects. This travel aftereffect was maintained after controlling for possible response biases and approaching effects, and …",2024
SAM LING,Characterizing the relationship between population spatial frequency tuning and receptive field size,"Receptive fields in early visual cortex change systematically with eccentricity and visual area. Model-based functional neuroimaging approaches provide a method to map and interrogate population receptive fields (pRF) and spatial frequency tuning (pSFT), though how closely the response properties derived from these methods correspond with one another remains unclear. Here, we compared pRF maps to pSFT estimates in early visual cortex (V1–V3). Preferred spatial frequency and bandwidth of voxel-wise pSFT were estimated with a log Gaussian function (see Aghajari, Vinke, & Ling, 2020). We then compared pSFT to receptive field sizes that were derived from a separate fMRI pRF mapping experiment. Our results confirm an inverse relationship between peak population spatial frequency preference and receptive field size that was strongest in V1 but persists across V2 and V3 (p< 0.001). In V1, we found …",2023
SAM LING,Orientation-tuned normalization modulates the gain of visuocortical contrast responses in humans,"Neural responses in early visual cortex are regulated by gain control mechanisms. Divisive normalization has been put forth as a unifying explanation for phenomena such as contrast response saturation, cross-orientation suppression, and surround suppression. The magnitude of suppression evoked by different visual stimuli determines the strength of neural responses in early visual cortex, and in turn, the subjective salience of the visual stimulus. Notably, suppression strength is modulated by feature similarity; for instance, responses to a center-surround stimulus in which the components are collinear to each other are weaker than when they are orthogonal. However, this feature-tuned aspect of normalization has been understudied, and we lack a clear picture of how the gain of responses is affected by feature-tuned normalization. Here, we examine the contribution of the tuned component of suppression to …",2023
SAM LING,Investigating the interaction between affective arousal and luminance in modulating pupil size,"Pupillometry is a popular measure for indexing arousal states. Recent work from the lab revealed that the pupillary effects of cognitive-effort-related arousal multiplicatively interact with luminance: the largest effects occur at low-to-mid luminances (< 37 cd/m2), implying a narrow range of conditions ideal for assessing cognitive arousal-driven pupillary differences. In this study, we examine how generalizable this finding is to other forms of arousal. To do so, we assessed how affective arousal-based pupillary modulation interact with luminance. In Experiment 1, participants (n= 28) listened to and rated sound clips from the International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) of Neutral (low arousal) and Negative (high arousal) valence, while maintaining fixation. To assess pupillary light response functions, the background luminance of the screen cycled through 10 luminance levels (0.92-233.34 cd/m2). In Experiment 2 …",2023
SAM LING,Eye closure elicits qualitatively distinct responses within the lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex,"Eyelids are potent filters of visual information. Despite its strong attenuation factor, our eyelids still pass light, allowing the visual system to potentially process some information in visual scenes. Subjective experience with high luminance visual stimuli suggests that even with closed eyes changes in luminance are detectable. However, the specific impact of eye closure on processing within the early visual system remains largely unknown. To better understand visual processing when eyes are shut, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess BOLD responses to a full-field flickering stimulus at high (100%) and low (10%) temporal contrasts, while participants viewed the stimuli with their eyes open and eyes closed. Interestingly, we discovered a qualitatively distinct pattern of effects within the visual thalamus and visual cortex. Replicating previous work in the lab, we found that with eyes open …",2023
SAM LING,How does cognitive arousal modulate visuocortical contrast response functions?,"Although animal work suggests that arousal state has a profound impact on visual responses, the effects on human vision remain less well understood. To better characterize the mechanisms by which arousal affects perception, in this study we assessed the influence of task difficulty on the gain of human visuocortical contrast response functions (CRFs). To do so, we leveraged an adaptation paradigm that homogenizes population responses, allowing us to better measure compressive, nonlinear CRFs with fMRI. After adapting visual cortex (adapter: 16% contrast), we then measured BOLD responses in early visual cortex (V1-V3) while participants (n= 14) viewed grating stimuli varying in contrast from trial to trial (9 contrast levels, 3% to 96% contrast). While viewing the stimuli, observers were instructed to concurrently solve auditory arithmetic problems which were categorized as either Easy (low arousal) or Hard …",2023
SAM LING,Feature-based attention modulates population spatial frequency tuning,"To enhance perception, it has been proposed that attention alters the receptive field properties of neurons tuned to the attended feature—effectively transforming visual processing downstream. Does attention toward a specific spatial frequency then alter spatial frequency processing in early visual cortex? Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure changes in population spatial frequency tuning (pSFT; see Aghajari, Vinke, & Ling, 2020), while subjects attended to specific spatial frequencies. We manipulated feature-based attention to spatial frequency by cueing subjects to perform a letter detection task on one of two super-imposed letter streams, positioned in one visual hemifield (eccentricity= 3.5; diameter= 3). Each letter stream was bandpass filtered to contain only low (0.5 cpd) or high (2 cpd) spatial frequency content (filter width= 0.1). In the opposite visual hemifield, we presented a …",2023
SAM LING,Spatial frequency tuning in early visual cortex in individuals with amblyopia,"Purpose: Amblyopia is characterized by visual deficits at high spatial frequencies in measures of contrast sensitivity and binocular vision. Model-based approaches to functional neuroimaging analysis provide a method to map and interrogate how population spatial frequency tuning (pSFT) may differ in early visual cortex between individuals with amblyopia and normally-sighted controls. We consider how voxel-wise spatial frequency tuning varies between the amblyopic and fellow eye and how this tuning varies as a function of receptive field size and eccentricity.Methods: We evaluated receptive field size and spatial frequency tuning in two individuals with amblyopia and two controls using model-based functional neuroimaging. Receptive field sizes were derived from monocular pRF mapping (Kay et al., 2013), and preferred spatial frequency and bandwidth were estimated with monocular pSFT mapping …",2023
SAM LING,The cost of divided attention for detection of simple visual features primarily reflects limits in post-perceptual processing,"Covert spatial attention allows us to prioritize processing at relevant locations. Perception is generally poorer when attention is distributed across multiple locations than when attention is focused on a single location. However, while divided attention typically impairs performance, recent work suggests that divided attention does not seem to impair detection of simple visual features. Here, we re-examined this possibility. In two experiments, observers detected a simple target (a vertical Gabor), and we manipulated whether attention was focused at one location (focal-cue condition) or distributed across two locations (distributed-cue condition). In Experiment 1, targets could appear independently at each location, such that observers needed to judge target presence for each location separately in the distributed-cue condition. Under these conditions, we found a robust cost of dividing attention. Next, we further probed …",2023
SAM LING,"Navigational systems in the human brain dynamically code for past, present, and future trajectories","Navigational trajectory planning requires the interaction of systems that include spatial orientation and memory. Here, we used a complex navigation task paired with fMRI pattern classification to examine head and travel direction tuning throughout the human brain. Rather than a single, static network, we report multiple simultaneous subnetworks that 1) have strong connections with both allocentric (world-centered) and egocentric (viewer-centered) movement trajectories, 2) change during the course of exploration, 3) code for past and future movements as well as the present direction, and 4) are strongest for individuals who convert their trajectories into egocentric movements once they have learned the environment. These findings shift our understanding of the neural processes underlying navigation from static structure-function relationships to a dynamic understanding of the multiple brain networks that  support active navigation. The insights into the nature of individual navigation abilities uncovered here challenge the dominant framework of largely allocentric coding for successful navigation in complex environments, and replace this with a new framework that relies on multiple co-existing dynamic computations.",2023
SAM LING,Feature-based attention multiplicatively boosts contrast-response functions measured with fMRI,"Although fMRI has played a central role in the study of attention, growing evidence suggests that the BOLD signal may be insensitive to attentional modulation of stimulus-driven responses. While electrophysiological studies find that attention multiplicatively scales contrast-response functions (CRFs), fMRI studies find a different pattern: attention produces an additive baseline shift in the BOLD signal that is independent of stimulus contrast. This finding suggests that attentional effects measured with fMRI reflect top-down inputs to visual cortex, rather than the modulation of stimulus-driven activity. If this is the case, fMRI may provide little insight about how attention improves sensory coding. Here, we re-examined whether fMRI is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention, using a feature-based attention (FBA) paradigm designed to preclude additive effects. We manipulated FBA in one hemifield, and measured …",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Decidual immune response following COVID-19 during pregnancy varies by timing of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection,"While COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is common, fetal transmission is rare, suggesting that intrauterine mechanisms form an effective blockade against SARS-CoV-2. Key among these is the decidual immune environment of the placenta. We hypothesize that decidual leukocytes are altered by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and that this decidual immune response is shaped by the timing of infection during gestation. To address this hypothesis, we collected decidua basalis tissues at delivery from women with symptomatic COVID-19 during second (2nd Tri COVID, n = 8) or third trimester (3rd Tri COVID, n = 8) and SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (Control, n = 8). Decidual natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and T cells were evaluated using quantitative microscopy, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR …",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: a review of the science and a look toward the use of buprenorphine for affected infants,"Neonates born to mothers taking opioids during pregnancy are at risk for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), for which there is no recognized standard approach to care. Nonpharmacologic treatment is typically used as a first-line approach for management, and pharmacologic treatment is added when clinical signs are not responding to nonpharmacologic measures alone. Although morphine and methadone are the most commonly used pharmacotherapies for NOWS, buprenorphine has emerged as a treatment option based on its pharmacologic profile and results from initial single site clinical trials. The objective of this report is to provide an overview of NOWS including a summary of ongoing work in the field and to review the state of the science, knowledge gaps, and practical considerations specific to the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of NOWS as discussed by a panel of experts during a …",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol# 21: breastfeeding in the setting of substance use and substance use disorder (revised 2023),"Background: The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) revised the 2015 version of the substance use disorder (SUD) clinical protocol to review the evidence and provide updated literature-based recommendations related to breastfeeding in the setting of substance use and SUD treatments.Key Information: Decisions around breastfeeding are an important aspect of care during the peripartum period, and there are specific benefits and risks for substance-exposed mother–infant dyads.Recommendations: This protocol provides breastfeeding recommendations in the setting of nonprescribed opioid, stimulant, sedative-hypnotic, alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis use, and SUD treatments. Additionally, we offer guidance on the utility of toxicology testing in breastfeeding recommendations. Individual programs and institutions should establish consistent breastfeeding approaches that mitigate bias, facilitate …",2023
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Evaluation of maternal-infant dyad inflammatory cytokines in pregnancies affected by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in early and late gestation,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces significant inflammatory cytokine production in adults, but infant cytokine signatures in pregnancies affected by maternal SARS-CoV-2 are less well characterized. We aimed to evaluate cytokine profiles of mothers and their infants following COVID-19 in pregnancy.Serum samples at delivery from 31 mother-infant dyads with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy (COVID) were examined in comparison to 29 control dyads (Control). Samples were evaluated using a 13-plex cytokine assay.In comparison with controls, interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) were higher in COVID maternal and infant samples (p < 0.05) and IL-8 uniquely elevated in COVID infant samples (p < 0.05). Significant elevations in IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8 were found among both early (1st/2nd Trimester) and late (3rd Trimester) maternal SARS-CoV …",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Caring for families impacted by opioid use: a qualitative analysis of integrated program designs,"We sought to 1) identify models of integrated care that offer medical care and social services for children and families impacted by opioid use disorder (OUD) in the postpartum year; and 2) describe how each program was developed, designed, and sustained, and explore facilitators and barriers to implementation of a dyadic, two-generation approach to care.In-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 23) were conducted with programs for women and children affected by OUD across North America. Using a phenomenologic approach, key program components and themes were identified. Following thematic saturation, these results were triangulated with experts in program implementation and with a subset of key informants to ensure data integrity.Five distinct types of programs were identified that varied in the degree of medical and behavioral care for families. Three themes emerged unique …",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Effect of prenatal opioid exposure on the human placental methylome,"Prenatal exposure to addictive drugs can lead to placental epigenetic modifications, but a methylome-wide evaluation of placental DNA methylation changes after prenatal opioid exposure has not yet been performed. Placental tissue samples were collected at delivery from 19 opioid-exposed and 20 unexposed control full-term pregnancies. Placental DNA methylomes were profiled using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. Differentially methylated CpG sites associated with opioid exposure were identified with a linear model using the ‘limma’ R package. To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) spanning multiple CpG sites, the ‘DMRcate’ R package was used. The functions of genes mapped by differentially methylated CpG sites and DMRs were further annotated using Enrichr. Differentially methylated CpGs (n = 684, unadjusted p < 0.005 and |∆β| ≥ 0.05) were mapped to 258 genes (including PLD1, MGAM, and ALCS2). Differentially methylated regions (n = 199) were located in 174 genes (including KCNMA1). Enrichment analysis of the top differentially methylated CpG sites and regions indicated disrupted epigenetic regulation of genes involved in synaptic structure, chemical synaptic transmission, and nervous system development. Our findings imply that placental epigenetic changes due to prenatal opioid exposure could result in placental dysfunction, leading to abnormal fetal brain development and the symptoms of opioid withdrawal in neonates.",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in pregnancy is associated with placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 shedding,"While the human placenta may be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the rate of fetal transmission is low, suggesting a barrier at the maternal-fetal interface. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is regulated by a metalloprotease cleavage enzyme, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17 (ADAM17). ACE2 is expressed in the human placenta, but its regulation in relation to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is not well understood. This study evaluated ACE2 expression, ADAM17 activity, and serum ACE2 abundance in a cohort of matched villous placental and maternal serum samples from control pregnancies (SARS-CoV-2 negative, n = 8) and pregnancies affected by symptomatic maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections in the second trimester [2nd Tri coronavirus disease (COVID), n = 8] and third trimester (3rd Tri COVID, n …",2022

The objective of this study is to examine the outcomes in a cohort of pregnancies treated with BUP-NX versus buprenorphine (BUP).MethodsThis single-center, retrospective cohort study examined birthing person-infant dyads treated with BUP-NX versus BUP. The primary birthing person outcome was return to opioid use in pregnancy. The primary neonatal outcome was the need for pharmacologic treatment for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).ResultsThe BUP-NX and the BUP treatment groups included 33 and 73 dyads, respectively.

ELISHA M WACHMAN,The impact of maternal SARS‐Cov‐2 vaccination and first trimester infection on Feto‐Maternal immune responses,"COVID‐19 infection during pregnancy increases maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Infection in the second or third trimester leads to changes in the decidual leukocyte populations. However, it is not known whether COVID‐19 infection in the first trimester or COVID‐19 vaccination during pregnancy alters the decidual immune environment.We examined decidual biopsies obtained at delivery from women who had COVID‐19 in the first trimester (n = 8), were fully vaccinated against COVID‐19 during pregnancy (n = 17), or were neither infected nor vaccinated during pregnancy (n = 9). Decidual macrophages, NK cells, and T cells were quantified by immunofluorescence.

ELISHA M WACHMAN,SARS-CoV-2 in infant urine and fecal samples after in utero COVID-19 exposure,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has and will continue to affect many pregnant women. Knowledge regarding the risk of vertical transmission is limited. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs typically have been used to confirm the diagnosis among infants, but whether the virus can be detected in other biological specimens, and therefore potentially transmitted in other ways, is unknown. Positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR has been reported from feces and urine from adult patients. We hypothesize that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in infant urine and fecal samples after prenatal COVID-19 exposure is low.We examined the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR in urine and fecal samples among 42 infants born to SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers …",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: a comparison of as-needed pharmacotherapy,"Methadone and morphine are commonly administered medications for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). Infants are increasingly treated with as-needed or “pro re nata” (PRN) medication. The optimal pharmacologic agent for PRN treatment of NOWS has not been examined. This study’s objective is to compare NOWS hospital outcomes between infants treated with PRN methadone versus morphine.We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants pharmacologically treated for NOWS across 4 Massachusetts hospitals between January 2018 and February 2021.

ELISHA M WACHMAN,Decreased myelin-related gene expression in the nucleus accumbens during spontaneous neonatal opioid withdrawal in the absence of long-term behavioral effects in adult outbred …,"Prenatal opioid exposure is a major health concern in the United States, with the incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) escalating in recent years. NOWS occurs upon cessation of in utero opioid exposure and is characterized by increased irritability, disrupted sleep patterns, high-pitched crying, and dysregulated feeding. The main pharmacological strategy for alleviating symptoms is treatment with replacement opioids. The neural mechanisms mediating NOWS and the long-term neurobehavioral effects are poorly understood. We used a third trimester-approximate model in which neonatal outbred pups (Carworth Farms White; CFW) were administered once-daily morphine (15 mg/kg, s.c.) from postnatal day (P) day 1 through P14 and were then assessed for behavioral and transcriptomic adaptations within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) on P15. We also investigated the long-term effects of …",2023
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Case Series of Individuals Treated with Naltrexone during Pregnancy for Opioid and/or Alcohol Use Disorder,"ObjectiveThere is a lack of knowledge about the relative safety and efficacy of naltrexone for the treatment of pregnant individuals with opioid and/or alcohol use disorder, including the range of outcomes, in both the pregnant individual and the infant, over the course of peripartum period. Our objective was to describe these outcomes in a cohort of pregnant individuals on naltrexone.MethodsIn this prospective case series, 7 pregnant individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) or alcohol use disorder (AUD) treated with naltrexone were followed from pregnancy through 12 months after delivery. Clinical treatment protocols and outcomes related to safety and efficacy during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period are described.ResultsThere were 4 pregnant individuals with OUD and 3 with AUD, of which 3 were managed with oral and 4 with extended-release naltrexone. The mean gestational age at study …",2023
ELISHA M WACHMAN,A comparison of postpartum opioid consumption and opioid discharge prescriptions among opioid-naïve patients and those with opioid use disorder,"Management of patients with opioid use disorder during the acute postpartum period remains clinically challenging as obstetricians aim to mitigate postdelivery pain while optimizing recovery support.This study aimed to evaluate postpartum opioid consumption and opioids prescribed at discharge among patients with opioid use disorder treated with methadone, buprenorphine, and no medication for opioid use disorder, as compared with opioid-naïve counterparts.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients who underwent delivery at >20 weeks’ gestation at a tertiary academic hospital between May 2014 and April 2020. The primary outcome of this analysis was the mean daily quantity of oral opioids consumed after delivery while inpatient, in milligrams of morphine equivalents. Secondary outcomes included the following: (1) quantity of oral opioids …",2023
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Drivers of decision-making regarding infant sleep practices among mothers with opioid use disorder,"To understand the perspectives and perceived facilitators of and barriers to following safe infant sleeping practices among mothers with opioid use disorder (OUD).Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework, we conducted qualitative interviews with mothers with OUD regarding infant sleep practices. We created codes and generated themes, concluding data collection upon achieving thematic saturation.Twenty-three mothers with infants 1–7 months of age were interviewed from 08/2020 to 10/2021. Mothers chose sleeping practices they perceived made their infants safer, more comfortable, and minimized infant withdrawal symptoms. Mothers in residential treatment facilities were influenced by facility infant sleep rules. Hospital sleep modeling and varied advice by providers, friends and family influenced maternal decisions.Mothers reported factors unique to …",2023
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Medication for opioid use disorder during pregnancy—maternal and infant network to understand outcomes associated with use of medication for opioid use disorder during …,"Problem: Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is recommended for persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy. However, knowledge gaps exist about best practices for management of OUD during pregnancy and these data are needed to guide clinical care.Period Covered: 2014–2021.Description of the System: Established in 2019, the Maternal and Infant Network to Understand Outcomes Associated with Medication for Opioid Use Disorder During Pregnancy (MAT-LINK) is a surveillance network of seven clinical sites in the United States. Boston Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, The Ohio State University, and the University of Utah were the initial clinical sites in 2019. In 2021, three clinical sites were added to the network (the University of New Mexico, the University of Rochester, and the University of South Florida). Persons receiving care at the seven clinical sites are diverse in terms of geography, urbanicity, race and ethnicity, insurance coverage, and type of MOUD received. The goal of MAT-LINK is to capture demographic and clinical information about persons with OUD during pregnancy to better understand the effect of MOUD on outcomes and, ultimately, provide information for clinical care and public health interventions for this population. MAT-LINK maintains strict confidentiality through robust information technology architecture. MAT-LINK surveillance methods, population characteristics, and evaluation findings are described in this inaugural surveillance report. This report is the first to describe the system, presenting detailed information on funding, structure, data elements, and methods as well as …",2023
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Comparison of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibody Signatures in Maternal and Infant Blood after COVID-19 Infection versus COVID-19 Vaccination during Pregnancy," Objective The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine for pregnant persons to prevent severe illness and death. The objective was to examine levels of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG, IgM, and IgA against spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) in maternal and infant/cord blood at delivery after COVID 19 vaccination compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection at in mother–infant dyads at specified time points.

Samples were collected at delivery and IgG, IgM, and IgA to RBD of spike and NCPs compared in the infected and vaccinated groups …",2024
ELISHA M WACHMAN,What to expect with pregnant or postpartum prescribing of extended-release buprenorphine (CAM2038),"Weekly and monthly CAM2038 (Brixadi®) extended-release subcutaneous buprenorphine (XR bup) has been available in Europe and Australia for several years and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in May 2023. Little is known about the clinical experience of patients and providers using this new medication during prenatal care. Two cases of pregnant persons with opioid use disorder receiving weekly XR bup in an ongoing randomized multi-site outpatient clinical trial are presented along with a brief review of the pharmacology and literature on XR bup formulations. The cases in pregnancy illustrate how treatment with the weekly formulation is initiated including how to make dose adjustments, which may be necessary given the longer half-life; it takes 1 month to achieve steady state. Injection site pain with medication administration was time limited and managed readily. Other injection site …",2023
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Cautionary Tales: The Use of Human Milk in Infants Born Preterm,"In the last 40 years, the use of human milk as the primary nutritional source for infants born preterm has changed from being a debatable novelty 1, 2 to being a de facto standard of care, 3 either as mother’s own milk (MOM) or, if MOM supply is inadequate, as donor human milk. Despite this, as 2 articles in this volume of The Journal remind us, 4, 5 there remains much to learn, or to re-learn, about the use of human milk in infants born preterm. Human milk has many non-nutritional advantages over artificial infant formulas, but it remains deficient in several key nutrients, including energy, protein, calcium, phosphate, and sodium. 6 Not only are the average contents of these nutrients low, but their variability is also wide. 7, 8 Standardized fortification (where all human milk samples receive the same level of fortification) can increase the average nutritional density of human milk but does nothing to reduce variability …",2022
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Trimester and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy,"SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy has been linked with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). The aim of this study was to examine how both trimester and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection impact HDP.We conducted a cohort study of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals during pregnancy (n = 205) and examined the association between trimester and severity of infection with incidence of HDP using modified Poisson regression models to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We stratified the analysis of trimester by severity to understand the role of timing of infection among those with similar symptomatology and also examined timing of infection as a continuous variable.Compared to a reference cohort from 2018, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not largely increase the risk of HDP (RR: 1.17; CI:0.90, 1.51), but a non-statistically significant …",2024
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Is Now the Time for Clonidine as a First-Line Agent for Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome?,"Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) remains a national crisis, affecting 6 to 8 per 1000 live births in the United States. 1 Nonpharmacologic treatment is considered the first-line of medical management for infants with NOWS, with pharmacotherapy being secondary. 2 Approximately 50% of infants with NOWS receive pharmacologic treatment with associated prolonged hospitalizations. 3, 4 There is currently no universally accepted pharmacologic treatment approach for NOWS; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends utilizing an opioid medication, such as morphine or methadone, as first-line pharmacotherapy. 2 There are very few studies that have examined nonopioid agents as first-line pharmacotherapy for NOWS. Clonidine is a nonopioid aÀ2-adrenergic agonist which inhibits noradrenaline release and decreases opioid withdrawal symptoms. Prior small clinical trials and cohort …",2024
ELISHA M WACHMAN,The ultrasonic vocalization (USV) syllable profile during neonatal opioid withdrawal and a kappa opioid receptor component to increased USV emissions in female mice,"Opioid use during pregnancy can lead to negative infant health outcomes, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). NOWS comprises gastrointestinal, autonomic nervous system, and neurological dysfunction that manifest during spontaneous withdrawal. Variability in NOWS severity necessitates a more individualized treatment approach. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in neonatal mice are emitted in isolation as a stress response and are increased during opioid withdrawal, thus modeling a negative affective state that can be utilized to test new treatments.We sought to identify the behavioral and USV profile, brainstem transcriptomic adaptations, and role of kappa opioid receptors in USVs during neonatal opioid withdrawal.We employed a third trimester-approximate opioid exposure model, where neonatal inbred FVB/NJ pups were injected twice-daily with morphine …",2024
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Racial and ethnic disparities in testing of Hepatitis C virus-exposed children across the United States,"Despite rising hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence among pregnant individuals in the United States, HCV testing among exposed infants remains low. Although recent guidelines recommend early RNA testing for HCV-exposed children to help improve testing rates, national studies describing factors associated with HCV testing and type of testing completed are lacking.In this retrospective national study, we characterized HCV testing and care among HCV-exposed infants born 2010-2020 captured in the electronic health record-based TriNetX Research Network. We analyzed factors associated with appropriate HCV testing completion (negative or positive HCV RNA testing or negative HCV antibody testing at any age through study end in 2022) and with RNA compared with antibody testing, using univariable and multivariable logistic regression with …",2024
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Trauma Prevalence and Its Association With Health-Related Quality of Life in Pregnant Persons with Opioid Use Disorder,"ObjectivesTrauma screening is recommended for pregnant persons with opioid use disorder (OUD), but there is limited literature on screening results from buprenorphine treatment. This study’s objectives were to 1) describe the types, and severity, of traumatic events reported and 2) evaluate the associations between trauma and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).MethodsBaseline data from an ongoing trial were analyzed. Participants were 155 pregnant persons with OUD receiving, or enrolling in, buprenorphine treatment at one of 13 sites. The experience, and relative severity, of 14 high magnitude stressors were assessed with the trauma history screen. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29+ 2 was used to assess 8 HRQoL domains.ResultsTraumatic stressors were reported by 91% of the sample (n= 155), with 54.8% reporting a lifetime persisting posttraumatic distress (PPD …",2024

The long-term outcomes of infants exposed to naltrexone has not been previously examined.To compare the neurobehavioral outcomes of naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone exposed infants.Multi-centered prospective cohort study.Pregnant people on prescribed buprenorphine-naloxone or naltrexone were enrolled during pregnancy and the dyad followed until 12 months after delivery.Infants were evaluated at 4–6 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA) using the NICU Neonatal Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) and at the 12-month CGA visit using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ-3).There were …",2024
ELISHA M WACHMAN,Hair Cortisol Concentrations in Opioid-Exposed versus Nonexposed Mother–Infant Dyads," Objective To pilot measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in pregnant women with opioid use disorder and their infants over time and study the potential utility of hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress in this population. Study Design In this pilot prospective cohort study of mother–infant dyads with and without prenatal opioid exposure, we obtained mother–infant HCCs at delivery and again within 1 to 3 months' postpartum. HCCs were compared between the opioid and control groups and between the two time points. Results There were no significant differences between opioid and control group maternal or infant HCCs at either time point. However, within the opioid-exposed group, there was a significant increase in infant HCCs across the two time points. Conclusion This pilot study describes our experience with the measurement of HCCs in opioid-exposed mother–infant dyads. Key Points ",2024

ELISHA M WACHMAN,Syphilis Screening During Pregnancy Among People with Opioid Use Disorder,"ObjectivePeople with opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy are at risk for syphilis and late prenatal care. This complicates preventing congenital syphilis, which requires treatment initiation at least 30 days before the pregnancy outcome. This analysis examines whether prescription of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is associated with timely syphilis screening (at least 30 days before the pregnancy outcome) among people with OUD during pregnancy.Study DesignMAT-LINK is a surveillance network of seven clinical sites collecting data on people with OUD during pregnancy from 2014 to 2021. Poisson regression models were used to test the association between MOUD (exposure) and the timing of syphilis screening (outcome).

ELISHA M WACHMAN,Spectrotemporal profiling of ultrasonic vocalizations during neonatal opioid withdrawal reveals a kappa opioid receptor component in female mice,"Opioid use during pregnancy can lead to negative infant health outcomes, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). NOWS comprises gastrointestinal, autonomic nervous system, and neurological dysfunction that manifest during spontaneous withdrawal. Current treatments involve non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, however, there is no one standardized approach, in part because of variability in NOWS severity. To effectively model NOWS traits in mice, we used a third trimester-approximate opioid exposure paradigm, where neonatal inbred FVB/NJ and outbred Carworth Farms White (CFW) pups were injected twice-daily with morphine (10-15mg/kg, sc) or saline (0.9%, 20 ul/g, sc) from postnatal day (P) one to P14.

ELISHA M WACHMAN,Opioid-Sparing in Children with Chronic Pain Who Are Eligible for Palliative Care,"DiscussionThis case highlights the challenge of safely managing chronic pain in a child with serious illness who is early in their disease trajectory or for whom prognostic data may be highly divergent, depending on the opinion and experience of subspecialists managing the underlying disease. Palliative care clinicians rely on the expertise of others to help prognosticate in patients with rare conditions. Patients, such as this girl, with complex chronic medical conditions are very commonly cared for by pediatric palliative care teams at tertiary care pediatric hospitals. In this case, clinicians in a previous institution felt that the child's prognosis could be months to a few years at best. Subspecialists in the subsequent institution felt this was highly pessimistic and that with current available treatment, the child should live for years or even decades with a good quality of life. This divergence in prognostic opinions, not …",2022
ADAM GUREN,The 2000s housing cycle with 2020 hindsight: A neo-kindlebergerian view,"With “2020 hindsight,” the 2000s housing cycle is not a boom–bust but a boom–bust–rebound. Using a spatial equilibrium regression in which house prices are determined by income, amenities, urbanization, and supply, we show that long-run city-level fundamentals predict not only 1997–2019 price and rent growth but also the amplitude of the boom–bust–rebound. This evidence motivates our model of a cycle rooted in fundamentals. Households learn about fundamentals by observing “dividends” but become over-optimistic in the boom due to diagnostic expectations. A bust ensues when beliefs start to correct, exacerbated by a price–foreclosure spiral that drives prices below their long-run level. The rebound follows as prices converge to a path commensurate with higher fundamental growth. The estimated model explains the boom–bust–rebound with a single shock and accounts quantitatively for the …",2024
ADAM GUREN,Discussion of “What Have They Been Thinking? Homebuyer Behavior in Hot and Cold Markets: A Ten-Year Retrospect” by Robert J. Shiller and Anne K. Thompson,"It is unusual to be asked to discuss a paper that is already a classic, but that is the predicament in which I find myself. This paper is a useful update on the path-breaking and influential work in the authors’ prior paper, Case, Shiller, and Thompson (2012). The natural place to start discussing this 10-year retrospective is thus with a 10-year retrospective discussion of the original paper. Explaining why it has been so influential and what its impact means for the current paper will give me an opportunity to discuss its methodology and the related literature and provide a brief user’s guide to their data. I will then turn to discussing the analysis of the last 10 years in housing markets and particularly the current pandemic housing market. My overall message is that the authors should be applauded for their important contribution: The field of housing economics is unquestionably better due to their adding survey expectations to our toolkit. I also think their big idea–that high long-run expectations can be used to diagnose a housing bubble, much like a yield curve inversion is used to predict a recession–is a useful one, although I think that survey evidence on expectations should be used in conjunction with other evidence rather than on its own.",2022
ADAM GUREN,Report on the potential impacts of property tax abatement on rental housing construction in Boston,"Boston’s high housing costs reflect a historic failure to build enough units to satisfy demand. Interest rates and construction costs have risen recently, and the flow of new market-rate residential housing projects has slowed. To spur more construction, the City of Boston is considering various policy options. Our committee was asked by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu to assess the market impacts of one of these options: real estate tax abatements. This report presents our analysis of the likely effects on the number of units constructed and the costs to taxpayers of various tax abatement alternatives. We do not recommend which policy, if any, the city should pursue; Boston officials are better positioned to assess whether the benefits of these policies warrant the costs to taxpayers.",2024
STEFANIA GARETTO,Global Banking and the International Transmission of Shocks: A Quantitative Analysis,"Regulatory reforms typically follow financial crises. We propose a model of global banking that can be used proactively to study alternative regulatory policies. The model mimics the US regulatory framework and highlights the organizational choices that banks face when entering a foreign market: branching versus subsidiarization. The model is able to replicate the response of the US banking sector to the European sovereign debt crisis. Counterfactual analysis suggests that pervasive subsidiarization, higher capital requirements, or an ad hoc monetary policy intervention would have avoided entirely the negative effects of the sovereign debt crisis on US lending. However, the same measures would have had limited effects in more severe scenarios.",2023
STEFANIA GARETTO,On the Origins of the Multinational Premium,"How do foreign direct investment (FDI) dynamics relate to the risk premium of a firm? To answer this question, we compare the stock returns of US firms with different FDI and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) exposure to study the evolution of stock returns as firms expand into foreign markets. We document three empirical regularities. First, there are cross-sectional risk premia associated with both multinational activity and mergers and acquisitions. Second, firm-level stock returns decline when a firm undertakes M&A activity and with merger deepening. Third, future multinational acquirers already have higher stock returns compared with domestic non-acquirers prior to entering foreign markets, indicating that cross-sectional returns differentials are driven by selection based on common unobserved firm characteristics. We find that CEOs play a role in explaining the relationship between firms' risk premia and foreign expansion. To rationalize these facts, we develop a dynamic model in which management attitudes shape the relationship between firm characteristics, selection into FDI, and risk premia.",2023
JAMES BIRD,Molecular complexity and diversity of persistent soil organic matter,"Managing and increasing organic matter in soil requires greater understanding of the mechanisms driving its persistence through resistance to microbial decomposition. Conflicting evidence exists for whether persistent soil organic matter (SOM) is molecularly complex and diverse. As such, this study used a novel application of graph networks with pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify the complexity and diversity of persistent SOM, defined as SOM that persists through time (soil radiocarbon age) and soil depth. We analyzed soils from the Cooloola giant podzol chronosequence across a large gradient of soil depths (0–15 m) and SOM radiocarbon ages (modern to 19,000 years BP). We found that the most persistent SOM on this gradient was highly aromatic and had the lowest molecular complexity and diversity. By contrast, fresh surface SOM had higher molecular complexity and diversity …",2023
JAMES BIRD,Directionally supervised cellular automaton for the initial peopling of Sahul,"Reconstructing the patterns of Homo sapiens expansion out of Africa and across the globe has been advanced using demographic and travel-cost models. However, modelled routes are ipso facto influenced by migration rates, and vice versa. We combined movement ‘superhighways’ with a demographic cellular automaton to predict one of the world's earliest peopling events — Sahul between 75000 and 50000 years ago. Novel outcomes from the superhighways-weighted model include (i) an approximate doubling of the predicted time to continental saturation (∼10,000 years) compared to that based on the directionally unsupervised model (∼5000 years), suggesting that rates of migration need to account for topographical constraints in addition to rate of saturation; (ii) a previously undetected movement corridor south through the centre of Sahul early in the expansion wave based on the scenarios assuming two …",2023
JAMES BIRD,"Environmental change inferred from multiple proxies from an 18 cal ka BP sediment record, Lake Barrine, NE Australia","Lake Barrine (17.25°S, 145.64°E), on the Atherton Tablelands in tropical northeast Australia, was formed as a maar lake in the late Pleistocene. The 65 m-deep stratified lake provides a detailed sediment record of climate and environmental change on the Tablelands. We reconstruct hydroclimate and vegetation change over the last ∼18,000 years from a 7.2 m long sediment core at 20-year resolution using multiple paleoenvironmental proxies (μ-XRF elements, δ13CTOC, TOC and C:N ratio). The data series are supported by a chronology based on 22 accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dates. The results suggest a distinct period of intense but highly seasonal rainfall coincident with the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14.7–13.0 cal ka BP). This period was followed by a trend into the early Holocene toward wetter, less seasonal conditions that allowed the progressive establishment of tropical forest in the …",2022
JAMES BIRD,Australian marine radiocarbon reservoir effects: ΔR atlas and ΔR calculator for Australian mainland coasts and near-shore islands,Studies of pre-bomb mollusks live-collected around the Australian coastline have concluded that near-shore marine radiocarbon reservoir effects are small and relatively uniform. These studies are based on limited samples of sometimes dubious quality representing only selective parts of Australia’s lengthy coastline. We systematically examine spatial variability in the marine radiocarbon reservoir effect (ΔR) through analysis of 292 live-collected mollusk samples across the Australian mainland coasts and near-shore islands subject to strict selection criteria. This study presents 233 new ΔR values combined with an evaluation of 59 previously published values. Results demonstrate significant spatial variability in marine radiocarbon reservoir effects across the study region.

For palaeofire records to contribute meaningfully to the reconstruction of past landscape fire history, it is helpful to identify the vegetation that has been burnt, for example, grassy versus woody vegetation in tropical savannas. The morphological characteristics of charcoal particles can provide useful information on source vegetation type, and the aspect ratio of charcoal particles has been proposed to identify the contribution of grasses to environmental records. Stable carbon isotope analysis of pyrogenic carbon can also chemically identify the proportion of C3 and C4 biomass in charcoal samples but has yet to be widely applied alongside charcoal morphological analysis. Using carbon isotope analysis we demonstrate that C3 sedges contribute elongate charcoal to a fire record where C4 grasses are absent. These results challenge the …",2022
JAMES BIRD,Thirty years of increased precipitation modifies soil organic matter fractions but not bulk soil carbon and nitrogen in a mesic grassland,"Grassland ecosystems, which are known to be sensitive to climate change, have shown minimal responses of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools to increased moisture availability, despite moisture-induced changes in plants and soil microbes (e.g., expected drivers of soil C and N). However, it is not clear if this apparent limited response is due to an unresponsive belowground system or because alterations in multiple soil organic matter (SOM) component pools and fluxes offset each other. To investigate potential responses of C and N in SOM to decadal increases in precipitation, we sampled soils from a 30-year precipitation augmentation experiment in an annually burned mesic grassland. We measured C and N in three SOM fractions which vary in their plant and microbial controls 1) free particulate OM (fPOM), 2) occluded POM plus heavy, coarse OM (oPOM + hcOM), and 3) mineral-associated OM (MAOM …",2023
JAMES BIRD,Hydrological processes in tropical Australia: Historical perspective and the need for a catchment observatory network to address future development,"Tropical Australia.Streams and rivers of the Australian tropics have been the subject of substantial hydrological process research spanning the last 50 years. In this review, we highlight initial efforts to understand the hydrological response of forested ecosystems in the humid tropics, and how this has been more recently followed by work in savannas of the seasonal tropics. We describe recent findings from modelling and tracer studies and derive a framework of dominant hydrological processes for the region. We also detail five critical knowledge gaps that will require further attention with climate change and ongoing interest in development in the region.We outline the diversity of runoff generation mechanisms that prevail in the region and emphasise the role of connected wetlands and floodplains in catchment response. We discuss the prominence of …",2022
JAMES BIRD,"Early Aboriginal pottery production and offshore island occupation on Jiigurru (Lizard Island group), Great Barrier Reef, Australia","Aboriginal manufacture and use of pottery was unknown in Australia prior to European settlement, despite well-known ceramic-making traditions in southern Papua New Guinea, eastern Indonesia, and the western Pacific. The absence of ancient pottery manufacture in mainland Australia has long puzzled researchers given other documented deep time Aboriginal exchange networks across the continent and the close proximity of pottery-bearing Lapita and post-Lapita maritime communities in the western Pacific with ocean-going watercraft and sophisticated navigation abilities. We report the oldest securely dated ceramics found in Australia from archaeological excavations on Jiigurru (Lizard Island Group) on the Great Barrier Reef, northeast Australia. Comprehensive radiocarbon dating and Bayesian modelling constrains ceramic deposition to between 2950–2545 cal BP and 1970–1815 cal BP. This timing …",2024
JAMES BIRD,Late Pleistocene emergence of an anthropogenic fire regime in Australia’s tropical savannahs,"At the time of European arrival on the Australian continent, sophisticated Indigenous societies practiced land management across Australia’s extensive tropical savannahs. Fire was one of the main tools people used to manipulate fuel loads and connectivity to reduce uncontrolled wildfire, maintain vegetation structure and enhance biodiversity. When this alteration of a ‘natural’ fire regime to a human-dominated fire regime occurred is not known. Here we assessed fire incidence and intensity over the past 150,000 years through a continuous lacustrine record by comparing the accumulation rates of micro-charcoal and stable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that form during the combustion of vegetation. We also compared grass (mainly C4) pollen as a percentage of total dryland pollen with the carbon isotope composition of the stable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. We established with high statistical certainty …",2024
JAMES BIRD,Coastal response to Holocene Sea-level change: A case study from Singapore,"The deceleration of early to mid-Holocene (10–7 cal. ka BP) relative sea-level rise (RSLR) played a key role in transforming coastal systems from estuaries to deltas. Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of coastal evolution provide case studies that can help project the response of modern coastal systems to future RSLR. The response of deltas to future RSLR is particularly important to South, Southeast and East Asia which collectively contain 71% of the global coastal population living below 10 m in elevation and 75% of the global coastal floodplain population. However, few Holocene studies of equatorial delta systems exist.Here, we investigate the early to mid-Holocene coastal response to decelerating rates of RSLR through paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the Kallang River Basin, Singapore. We produce a multi-proxy (sedimentology, stable carbon isotope, XRF elemental ratios) record from sediment core …",2023
JAMES BIRD,Provenance of aerosol black carbon over northeast Indian ocean and South China sea and implications for oceanic black carbon cycling,"Aerosol black carbon (BC) is a short-lived climate pollutant. The poorly constrained provenance of tropical marine aerosol BC hinders the mechanistic understanding of extreme climate events and oceanic carbon cycling. Here, we collected PM2.5 samples during research cruise NORC2016-10 through South China Sea (SCS) and Northeast Indian Ocean (NEIO) and measured the dual-carbon isotope compositions (δ13C–Δ14C) of BC using hydrogen pyrolysis technique. Aerosol BC exhibits six different δ13C−Δ14C isotopic spaces (i.e., isotope provinces). Liquid fossil fuel combustion, from shipping emissions and adjacent land, is the predominant source of BC over isotope provinces “SCS close to Chinese Mainland” (53.5%), “Malacca Strait” (53.4%), and “Open NEIO” (40.7%).

JAMES BIRD,"Paleo-temperature inferred from brGDGTs over the past 18 cal ka BP from Lake Barrine, tropical NE Australia","Terrestrial temperature exerts a major influence on vegetation distribution, the hydrologic cycle and many biogeochemical cycles. Yet little research into terrestrial paleo-temperature reconstruction has been conducted covering the last deglaciation in northern Australia, and recent global surface temperature reconstructions include no data from this area. Here, for the first time, we reconstructed the mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) at Lake Barrine in this region from 18.3 to 1.7 cal ka BP at a relatively high resolution (averaged 400 yr). This temperature reconstruction was based on separated 5- and 6-methyl brGDGTs (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) that are increasingly used to reconstruct terrestrial temperature because of their ubiquity and a preservation window of at least tens of millions of years. A 7.2 m master core from the center of the lake was extracted, along with five surface lake sediment …",2023

JAMES BIRD,A carbon and nitrogen isotope perspective on ancient human diet in the British Isles,"The stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope composition of human bone collagen is increasingly used to investigate past mobility and subsistence strategies. This study presents a compilation of 1298 carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of archaeological human bone collagen from the British Isles spanning much of the Holocene, along with a compilation of 4148 analyses of modern and ancient isotope analyses from the major marine and terrestrial dietary resources from the same region. We convert ancient human stable isotope data to modern diet equivalent (MDE) values for humans, and convert the isotope composition of ancient dietary items to modern tissue equivalent (MTE) isotope values. These conversions enable a direct comparison of ancient and modern datasets. Results for food groups (plants, grain, herbivores, omnivores, shellfish, freshwater fish and marine fish) show a remarkably …",2022
JAMES BIRD,Late Holocene climate change in northern Australia inferred from the archaeal lipids in Lake Barrine,"Understanding long-term climate change is particularly relevant in Australasia, where precipitation exhibits marked variability on annual and decadal timescales. Although numerous studies have investigated hydroclimate change during the Common Era in Australasia, high-quality records covering the late Holocene remain scarce in northern Australia. Here we present an isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) record from Lake Barrine, to evaluate the environmental significance of archaeal lipid-based proxies in the lake system and possible drivers of changes during the late Holocene. The fractional composition of isoprenoid GDGTs in the sediments from Lake Barrine is dominated by GDGT-0 and crenarchaeol. The ratio of crenarchaeol and its regio-isomer (cren/cren’), GDGT-0/crenarchaeol ratios and Methane Index suggest that a dominant contribution of archaeal lipids in Lake Barrine derived …",2023
JAMES BIRD,"Soil pyrogenic carbon in southern Amazonia: Interaction between soil, climate, and above-ground biomass","The Amazon forest represents one of the world’s largest terrestrial carbon reservoirs. Here, we evaluated the role of soil texture, climate, vegetation, and distance to savanna on the distribution and stocks of soil pyrogenic carbon (PyC) in intact forests with no history of recent fire spanning the southern Amazonia forest-Cerrado Zone of Transition (ZOT). In 19 one hectare forest plots, including three Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE, terra preta) sites with high soil PyC, we measured all trees and lianas with diameter ≥ 10 cm and analyzed soil physicochemical properties, including texture and PyC stocks. We quantified PyC stocks as a proportion of total organic carbon using hydrogen pyrolysis. We used multiple linear regression and variance partitioning to determine which variables best explain soil PyC variation. For all forests combined, soil PyC stocks ranged between 0.9 and 6.8 Mg/ha to 30 cm depth (mean 2.3 ± 1.5 Mg/ha) and PyC, on average, represented 4.3% of the total soil organic carbon (SOC). The most parsimonious model (based on AICc) included soil clay content and above-ground biomass (AGB) as the main predictors, explaining 71% of soil PyC variation. After removal of the ADE plots, PyC stocks ranged between 0.9 and 3.8 Mg/ha (mean 1.9 ± 0.8 Mg/ha–1) and PyC continued to represent ∼4% of the total SOC. The most parsimonious models without ADE included AGB and sand as the best predictors, with sand and PyC having an inverse relationship, and sand explaining 65% of the soil PyC variation. Partial regression analysis did not identify any of the components (climatic, environmental, and edaphic), pure or shared, as …",2022
JAMES BIRD,"A 33,000-year paleohydrological record from Sanamere Lagoon, north-eastern tropical savannas of Australia","There are very few records of past terrestrial environmental change of any time period for the Australian tropical savannas. Here we document the hydrological development of Sanamere Lagoon, north Queensland, from a 1.72 m sediment sequence with a basal age of ca. 33 ka. We measure a variety of proxies reflecting environmental change within and around the lagoon, including grain size, elemental and diatom abundance, and carbon and nitrogen isotope composition. By integrating the interpretation of multiple proxies, we show that regional climatic events, such as the reactivation of the monsoon at 15 ka and sea-level rise ending at 7 ka, are reflected in local ecosystem change and a diversity of biogeochemical responses in Sanamere Lagoon. This record makes a significant contribution to the development of records of environmental change from an under-studied region in tropical Australia through the …",2023
JAMES BIRD,Assessing the Reliability of a Small-Scale Legacy Radiocarbon Dataset Using Chronometric Transparency Approaches: Torres Strait Radiocarbon Database,"A new quality assurance framework was developed to assess the reliability of 14C ages from a small-scale legacy dataset from archaeological sites across the Torres Strait (northeastern Australia). Chronometric transparency principles were applied across three stages of data analysis, comprising of a basic, immediate, and advanced assessment of the 14C ages and associated metadata. Reliability ratings (1*, 2*, 3*, and 4*) were assigned to represent data confidence in individual radiocarbon ages. Results demonstrate the utility of radiocarbon ages of high, medium, and low reliability in creating chronological reconstructions. We determine that of the 343 14C ages, 73% were awarded a reliability rating of 3* or above.",2023
JAMES BIRD,Tropical environmental change in North Sumatra at the Last Glacial Maximum: Evidence from the stable isotope composition of cave guano,"Insular Southeast Asia is of critical importance to global biodiversity, climate, and socioeconomics. Past environmental histories are a crucial factor influencing contemporary patterns and, in this region, fluctuating sea-level and climate change during the Last Glacial Period (LGP) resulted in drastic changes in both land extent and vegetation cover. However, understanding the past environments of this tropical region is hampered by its sheer size and relative lack of traditional continental proxy records, such as lake sediments. To provide further insight into the response of vegetation to the changing environmental conditions, we use the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of a bat guano sequence from Liang Mbelen Cave in North Sumatra, to determine whether tropical grass (C4 vegetation) or forest (C3 vegetation) was present in the area from c. 30 to 10 cal kyr BP. Our results confirm the presence of C4 …",2022
JAMES BIRD,"Vegetation changes through stadial and interstadial stages of MIS 4 and MIS 3 based on a palynological analysis of the Girraween Lagoon sediments of Darwin, Australia","A palynological record from Girraween Lagoon sediments (Darwin region of the Northern Territory, Australia) provides detailed long-term insight into tropical savanna vegetation community patterns, climatic and fire relationships, through Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4: 71–57 thousand years ago, ka) and Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3: 57–29 ka). Owing to a lack of data in reconstructing northern Australian environments, this paper looks to define and describe to a greater degree the nature and scope of these stadial and interstadial stages for the region. Girraween Lagoon simultaneously provides proximal palaeoecological data for the time and region of Aboriginal people's first arrival into Australia, also encompassing the late Pleistocene continental decline of megafauna.

JAMES BIRD,"Paleosol-derived paleoclimate and paleoenvironment reconstruction of the Rukwa Rift Basin, Tanzania: implications for faunal dispersal in the Miocene–Pliocene","The East African Rift System records a key interval in the evolution of modern African ecosystems, documenting significant floral changes and faunal dispersals in the context of environmental shifts. To date, Miocene-to-Pliocene data from eastern Africa have been derived primarily from richly fossiliferous rift basins along the far north of the Eastern Branch of the rift, with more limited windows emerging from the Malawi Rift and more recently, coastal Mozambique. Here, we present the first quantitative paleoclimate data for the Miocene–Pliocene transition from the Western Branch of the East African Rift System, based on analyses of paleosols from the Rukwa Rift Basin. Paleosols derived from the fossiliferous late Miocene–early Pliocene lower Lake Beds succession in southwestern Tanzania preserve a shallow lacustrine setting grading into a system of alluvial fans and braided rivers with abundant floodplain …",2023
JAMES BIRD,Revisiting Michael Bonell's work on humid tropical rainforest catchments: Isotope tracers reveal seasonal shifts in catchment hydrology,"It has been almost 50 years since the foundational work at the Babinda catchments in North Queensland kickstarted the field of tropical hydrology globally. To expand upon this work and build a more generalized hydrological understanding of steep rainforest catchments, we studied the seasonal evolution of hydrological response from two catchments with broadly similar characteristics to the Babinda catchments. Both hydrometric and water stable isotope data were collected at relatively high frequencies during one wet season (Thompson Creek) and a 3‐year period (Atika Creek). The longer dataset spans a wide range of environmental conditions experienced in the humid tropics, including events that cover the wetting‐up transitional period of the wet season and tropical cyclones (TC). Both catchments displayed a fast streamflow response to rainfall with the shallow upper soil profile responding quickly to …",2022
JAMES BIRD,Stochastic population projections in Sahul refine the human-refugia hypothesis for early Last Glacial Maximum,"Pleistocene archaeology in Australia has focussed on the survival and behaviour of Indigenous populations across Sahul during the Last Glacial Maximum (28.6±2.8 ka to 17.7±2.2 ka). A long-standing conceptual model proposes people occupied ecological refugia while abandoning drier regions during extreme climatic conditions, with inferred patterns of subsequent recovery essential for describing the evolution of societies in the Holocene. Radiocarbon-derived population estimates partially support the conceptual model while genetic evidence does not, but how human populations were influenced by the Last Glacial Maximum remains untested. To test the refugia hypothesis, we developed a spatial-demographic model of human movement to project population patterns across Sahul from 40,000 years ago (ka) to the mid-Holocene (5 ka). The model predicts little population change in eastern Sahul or New Guinea during the Last Glacial Maximum. However, extensive movement and potential abandonment in the central-western deserts and the north-northwest coastal regions are predicted during the first half of the Last Glacial Maximum (~ 26–20 ka), with some recovery after 15 ka. The demographic implications to societies appear to have extended beyond the Last Glacial Maximum, with increasing populations not evident until the early Holocene in many regions. Our model describes a complex pattern where large areas of Sahul provided refugia that maintained populations throughout the Last Glacial Maximum, providing a possible explanation for the disparity between archaeological and genomic evidence. There was also a correlation …",2022
JAMES BIRD,"A radiocarbon chronology for Sanamere Lagoon, Cape York Peninsula, using multiple organic fractions","The selection and pre-treatment of reliable organic fractions for radiocarbon age determination is fundamental to the development of accurate chronologies. Sampling from tropical lakes is particularly challenging given the adverse preservation conditions and diagenesis in these environments. Our research is the first to examine and quantify the differences between radiocarbon ages from different carbon fractions and pretreatment protocols from tropical lake sediments. Six different organic fractions (bulk organics, pollen concentrate, cellulose, stable polycyclic aromatic carbon (SPAC), macrocharcoal >250 μm and microcharcoal >63 μm) were compared at six different depths along a 1.72 m long core extracted from Sanamere Lagoon, Cape York Peninsula, northern Australia.

JAMES BIRD,In-field carbon dioxide removal via weathering of crushed basalt applied to acidic tropical agricultural soil,"Enhanced weathering (EW) of silicate rocks such as basalt provides a potential carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology for combatting climate change. Modelling and mesocosm studies suggest significant CDR via EW but there are few field studies. This study aimed to directly measure in-field CDR via EW of basalt applied to sugarcane on acidic (pH 5.8, 0–0.25 m) Ultisol in tropical northeastern Australia, where weathering potential is high. Coarsely crushed basalt produced as a byproduct of gravel manufacture (<5 mm) was applied annually from 2018 to 2022 at 0 or 50 t ha−1 a−1, incorporated into the soil in 2018 but not in subsequent years. Measurements in 2022 show increased soil pH and extractable Mg and Si at 0–0.25 m depth, indicating significant weathering of the basalt, but showed no increase in crop yield.

Yet, few studies have combined and compared n-alkanes in modern plants and paleoenvironmental records. Here we analyzed the δ13C and δ2H values of n-alkanes (δ13Calk and δ2Halk, respectively) from a 7-m-long sediment sequence in Lake Barrine, modern catchment soils, fallen leaf mixtures, rainforest tree leaves and grasses from tropical northeastern Australia. We exploited the correlation between the relative abundances, δ13C, and δ2H values of n-alkanes from fresh modern rainforest leaves, grasses, fallen leaves, soils and surface sediments. Based on this, we developed two binary mixing models to determine C3 plant abundances and the δ2H values of precipitation (δ2HP-R) to study rainfall and vegetation in the Lake Barrine catchment …",2024
JAMES BIRD,Millennial-aged pyrogenic carbon in high-latitude mineral soils,"Wildfires in the Arctic are producing pyrogenic carbon as product of incomplete biomass combustion. The storage and distribution of pyrogenic carbon in soils is poorly known, especially in carbon rich permafrost-affected mineral soils. Here, we extracted pyrogenic carbon in mineral soils from eleven forest sites across the North Canadian permafrost regions by hydrogen pyrolysis. We found pyrogenic carbon with millennial-scale ages that were older in continuous (1960–12,690 calibrated years before present) than in discontinuous (510–3560 calibrated years before present) permafrost-affected soils. In all cases, pyrogenic carbon showed longer residence times compared to bulk soil organic carbon. The proportions of pyrogenic carbon on total soil organic carbon were consistent at 6.9 ± 0.5% of total soil organic carbon. Thus, pyrogenic carbon forms a significant component of the total soil organic carbon and …",2024
JAMES BIRD,"Heinrich events drove major intensification of the Indo-Australian monsoon over the last 150,000 years","Nearly two thirds of the world’s population depend on monsoon rainfall. Monsoon failure and extreme precipitation have affected societies for millennia. The distribution and amount of monsoon precipitation is predicted to change as the climate warms, albeit with uncertain regional trajectories. Multiple glacialinterglacial terrestrial records of east Asian monsoon variability have been developed, but there are no terrestrial records of equivalent length of the coupled Indo-Australian monsoon at the southern monsoon limit—Australia. Here we present a continuous, absolute-dated, 150,000-year record of monsoon dynamics from a permanent lagoon in the core monsoon region of northern Australia. We show that Australian rainfall is broadly anti-phased with the East Asian monsoon. We identify periods of intense monsoon activity associated with high local insolation in Marine Isotope Stage 5 during ‘megalake’phases in Australia’s arid interior. We also identify periods of monsoon intensi cation that are associated with Heinrich events and coincide with weak monsoon events in East Asia. The results suggest that strong asymmetry in inter-hemispheric monsoon rainfall might accompany the current weakening in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This asymmetry will involve drying in the heavily populated regions north of the equator, and intensi cation of rainfall in northern Australia.",2024
JAMES BIRD,"Holocene savanna hydroclimate record from Kinrara Lake, north-east Queensland, Australia","We present a record of hydroclimatic change over the Holocene from Kinrara Lake, in a seasonally dry savanna location in north-eastern Australia. The record is derived from the oxygen (δ18O) and carbon stable isotope (δ13C) composition of endogenic and biogenic (gastropod) carbonate. The stable isotope proxy records are complemented by elemental geochemical (Itrax) and sedimentological proxy data providing a record of hydrologic and climate change, spanning 10.5 ka to the present day. Two main forms of endogenic carbonate occur in the lake sediments; (i) carbonate associated with biofilms during the early-Holocene, under drier-than-modern conditions, (ii) photosynthetic and evaporatively-enriched precipitates in the late-Holocene, associated with enhanced climate variability inducing drought periods.

JAMES BIRD,Hominin Response to Oscillations in Climate and Local Environments During the Mid‐Pleistocene Climate Transition in Northern China,"Archeological evidence from loess sediments from Shangchen on the southeastern Chinese Loess Plateau indicates a suspension of hominin occupation around the time of the early mid‐Pleistocene climate transition, prompting a re‐assessment of climate‐vegetation‐hominin interactions. Loess deposits with in situ lithic records cover the period of hominin occupation and reveal four distinct climate‐vegetation periods (2.1–1.8, 1.8–1.26, 1.26–0.9, and 0.9–0.6 Ma). Major oscillations in climate superimposed upon an aridification trend and an expansion of C4 herbaceous vegetation from about 1.26 Ma may have driven early humans to move to more hospitable locations in the region. Comparison with the record at Nihewan indicates that large‐scale climate oscillations induced disparate hominin responses due to distinctive local environmental conditions.",2023
JAMES BIRD,"One year of spectroscopic high‐frequency measurements of atmospheric CO2, CH4, H2O and δ13C‐CO2 at an Australian Savanna site","We provide a 1‐year dataset of atmospheric surface CO2, CH4 and H2O concentrations and δ13C‐CO2 values from an Australian savanna site. These semi‐arid ecosystems act as carbon sinks in wet years but the persistence of the sink in dry years is uncertain. The dataset can be used to constrain uncertainties in modelling of greenhouse gas budgets, improve algorithms for satellite measurements and characterize the role of vegetation and soil in modulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We found pronounced seasonal variations in daily mean CO2 concentrations with an increase (by 5–7 ppmv) after the first rainfall of the wet season in early December with peak concentrations maintained until late January. The CO2 increase reflected the initiation of rapid microbial respiration from soil and vegetation sources upon initial wetting. As the wet season progressed, daily CO2 concentrations were variable, but …",2023
JAMES BIRD,Ancient fires enhance Amazon forest drought resistance,"Drought and fire reduce productivity and increase tree mortality in tropical forests. Fires also produce pyrogenic carbon (PyC), which persists in situ for centuries to millennia, and represents a legacy of past fires, potentially improving soil fertility and water holding capacity and selecting for the survival and recruitment of certain tree life-history (or successional) strategies. We investigated whether PyC is correlated with physicochemical soil properties, wood density, aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics and forest resistance to severe drought. To achieve our aim, we used an Amazon-wide, long-term plot network, in forests without known recent fires, integrating site-specific measures of forest dynamics, soil properties and a unique soil PyC concentration database. We found that forests with higher concentrations of soil PyC had both higher soil fertility and lower wood density. Soil PyC was not associated with AGC dynamics in non-drought years. However, during extreme drought events (10% driest years), forests with higher concentrations of soil PyC experienced lower reductions in AGC gains (woody growth and recruitment), with this drought-immunizing effect increasing with drought severity. Forests with a legacy of ancient fires are therefore more likely to continue to grow and recruit under increased drought severity. Forests with high soil PyC concentrations (third quartile) had 3.8% greater AGC gains under mean drought, but 33.7% greater under the most extreme drought than forests with low soil PyC concentrations (first quartile), offsetting losses of up to 0.68 Mg C ha–1yr–1 of AGC under extreme drought events. This suggests that ancient …",2023

JAMES BIRD,Revisiting Michael Bonell’s humid tropical rainforest catchments: isotope tracers reveal seasonal and inter-annual shifts in catchment hydrology,"It has been almost 50 years since Mike Bonell’s foundational work in the humid tropics, kickstarting the field of tropical hydrology. In order to expand on this work and build a more generalized hydrological understanding of steep rainforest catchments, we studied the seasonal and inter-annual evolution of hydrological response from two catchments with similar characteristics to those studied by Bonell. Both hydrometric and water stable isotope data were collected at relatively high frequencies during one wet season (Thompson Creek) and a three-year period (Atika Creek). The longer dataset spans a wide range of environmental conditions experienced in the humid tropics, including events that cover the wetting-up transitional period of the wet season, ENSO events and tropical cyclones. Both catchments displayed fast streamflow response to rainfall with the shallow upper soil profile responding quickly to rainfall at Atika Creek. New findings from this study include the importance of pre-event water (> 50%) for overall event flows, especially when the catchment was wet. Rainfall, surface runoff and groundwater isotope compositions varied between rainfall events with the most complex mixing plots observed for multi-peak events that occurred at the start of the wet season and after a dry period within the wet season. Inter-annual variability in catchment hydrology reflected changing ENSO conditions and the 2020-21 La Ninã wet season was characterized by several tropical cyclone events which generated the most 18O-depleted rainfall and streamflow isotope values. Our findings highlight the requirement for high frequency multi-source sampling …",2022
JAMES BIRD,4-INTERFERENCE OF BOUND IONS,"Interference, or mutual reinforcing and neutralizing of waves, is common to wave systems of different natures: elastic, electromagnetic, etc., for which the superposition principle holds.

If the observable is a non-linear function of amplitude, eg, intensity, which varies with the squared amplitude modulus, then the distribution of that observable will display an interference. The intensity of the resulting wave at any point| A| 2=∑ i| A i| 2+∑ i≠ j A j* A j is seen to differ from the sum of the intensities of the component waves, which is exactly what constitutes reinforcing and neutralizing of waves.According to the L. de Broglie hypothesis (1924) on the universal nature of the corpuscular-wave dualism, wave properties are inherent in any matter particles, and not only in photons …",2022

One such system is text-to-image generative AI (e.g. Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans’ artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000 unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25% and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of receiving a favorite per view by 50%. While peak artwork Content Novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average Content Novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average Visual Novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements. Importantly, AI-assisted …",2024
DOKYUN LEE,The consequences of generative AI for online knowledge communities,"Generative artificial intelligence technologies, especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, are revolutionizing information acquisition and content production across a variety of domains. These technologies have a significant potential to impact participation and content production in online knowledge communities. We provide initial evidence of this, analyzing data from Stack Overflow and Reddit developer communities between October 2021 and March 2023, documenting ChatGPT’s influence on user activity in the former. We observe significant declines in both website visits and question volumes at Stack Overflow, particularly around topics where ChatGPT excels. By contrast, activity in Reddit communities shows no evidence of decline, suggesting the importance of social fabric as a buffer against the community-degrading effects of LLMs. Finally, the decline in participation on Stack Overflow is found …",2024
DOKYUN LEE,Demand interactions in sharing economies: Evidence from a natural experiment involving airbnb and uber/lyft,"The authors examine whether and how ride-sharing services influence the demand for home-sharing services. Their identification strategy hinges on a natural experiment in which Uber/Lyft exited Austin, Texas, in May 2016 due to local regulation. Using a 12-month longitudinal data set of 11,536 Airbnb properties, they find that Uber/Lyft's exit led to a 14% decrease in Airbnb occupancy in Austin. In response, hosts decreased the nightly rate by $9.30 and the supply by 4.5%. The authors argue that when Uber/Lyft exited Austin, the transportation costs for most Airbnb guests increased significantly because most Airbnb properties (unlike hotels) have poor access to public transportation. The authors report three key findings: First, demand became less geographically dispersed, falling (increasing) for Airbnb properties with poor (excellent) access to public transportation. Second, demand decreased significantly for low …",2022
DOKYUN LEE,Innovae: Generative ai for understanding patents and innovation,"A lack of interpretability limits the use of common unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) in contexts where they are meant to augment managerial decision-making. We develop a generative deep learning model based on a Variational AutoEncoder (“InnoVAE”) that converts unstructured patent text into an interpretable, spatial representation of innovation (“Innovation Space”). After validating the internal consistency of the model, we apply it to three decades of computing system patents to show that our approach can be used to construct economically interpretable measures—at scale—that characterize a firm’s IP portfolio from the text of its patents, such as whether a patent is a breakthrough innovation, the volume of intellectual property enclosed by a portfolio of patents, or the density of patents at a point in Innovation Space. We show that for explaining innovation outcomes, these interpretable, engineered features have explanatory power that augments and often surpasses the structured patent variables that have informed the very large and influential literature on patents and innovation. Our findings illustrate the potential of using generative methods on unstructured data to guide managerial decision-making",2022
DOKYUN LEE,Guided diverse concept miner (GDCM): Uncovering relevant constructs for managerial insights from text,"Guided Diverse Concept Miner (GDCM) is an interpretable deep learning algorithm to (1) automatically extract corpus-level concepts from text data, (2) focus the discovery of concepts to filter through only the concepts highly correlated to the user-specified managerial outcome, and (3) quantify the concept’s correlational importance to the outcome. GDCM is used to explore and potentially extract previously unknown concepts and insights from the text that may explain the managerial outcome, without the need to provide any human-predefined guidance or labeled data on concepts. GDCM embeds words, documents, and concepts all in the same vector space, enabling easy interpretation of discovered concepts by associating words local to the concept vector. GDCM is explicitly configured to increase recovered-concept diversity, coherence, and relevance to managerial outcomes. We demonstrate GDCM as a …",2024
DOKYUN LEE,Influence via ethos: On the persuasive power of reputation in deliberation online,"Deliberation among individuals online plays a key role in shaping the opinions that drive votes, purchases, donations, and other critical offline behavior. Yet, the determinants of opinion change via persuasion in deliberation online remain largely unexplored. Our research examines the persuasive power of ethos—an individual’s “reputation”—using a seven-year panel of over a million debates from an argumentation platform containing explicit indicators of successful persuasion. We identify the causal effect of reputation on persuasion by constructing an instrument for reputation from a measure of past debate competition and by controlling for unstructured argument text using neural models of language in the double machine-learning framework. We find that an individual’s reputation significantly impacts their persuasion rate above and beyond the validity, strength, and presentation of their arguments. In our setting …",2024

The use of economic incentives under the ubiquitous mobile ecosystem for prosocial behavior has been shown to be particularly effective. He build on the previous work on this topic and study how mobile-based economic incentives and environments influence charitable giving behavior. In contrast to traditional fund-raising, we consider the use of mobile devices to generate giving in small denominations, which we term microgiving. In collaboration with a US-based mobile app provider, we incorporated a functionality that allowed users to contribute their in-app reward points to charity. To encourage donations, we used economic incentives in the form of monetary subsidies, ie, rebates or matching grants, as well as digital nudges in the form of push notifications.

DOKYUN LEE,How Do Fast-Fashion Copycats Affect the Popularity of Premium Brands? Evidence from Social Media,"The erosion of high-end fashion brands by fast-fashion copycats (e.g., Zara, H&M) has stirred controversies and unceasing legal attempts to copyright fashion designs. Despite the purported negative impact of copycats, the effect of fashion copycats on high-end brands remains empirically unclear. Research on this topic has been impeded by the absence of a modeling framework to quantify fashion and by the lack of consumer-level data on fashion choices. The authors collect data on the posting behaviors of consumers on a fashion-specific social media platform and develop a dynamic structural model with deep learning image analytics to characterize consumers’ choices of brands and styles. Results suggest that fast-fashion copycats can both harm high-end brands (a cannibalization effect) and help them (a market expansion effect). The authors also identify both static and dynamic mechanisms that contribute to …",2023
DOKYUN LEE,M&A and innovation: A new classification of patents,"Policymakers are increasingly concerned that incumbent acquisitions of small or young firms may slow down rather than speed up innovation, but it is difficult to identify which firms are related in the fast-changing space of technological innovation. This paper proposes a new, data-driven method to classify patent data into tech-business zones on a probabilistic basis, using patent assignee information. After combining mergers and acquisitions data from S&P Global Market Intelligence with PatentsView data from the US Patent and Trademark Office, we discuss how the zone classification can aid merger reviews and other lines of research.",2023

After validating the internal consistency of our approach, we apply it to three decades of AI patents to show that it can be used to construct interpretable measures, at scale, that characterize firms' AI-based IP portfolios. We demonstrate three use cases including (1) generating technology landscapes that inform businesses about their competitive positions,(2) engineering new, intuitive features from unstructured text that facilitate analysis of patent activity, and (3) augmenting patent applications to mitigate the risk of patent rejection.

MAYANK VARIA,Balanced byzantine reliable broadcast with near-optimal communication and improved computation,"This paper studies Byzantine reliable broadcast (BRB) under asynchronous networks, and improves the state-of-the-art protocols from the following aspects. Near-optimal communication cost: We propose two new BRB protocols for n nodes and input message M that has communication cost O(n|M|+n2 logn), which is nearoptimal due to the lower bound of Ω(n|M|+n2). The first RBC protocol assumes threshold signature but is easy to understand, while the second RBC protocol is error-free but less intuitive. Improved computation:We propose a newconstruction that improves the computation cost of the state-of-the-art BRB by avoiding the expensive online error correction on the input message, while achieving the same communication cost. Balanced communication: We propose a technique named balanced multicast that can balance the communication cost for BRB protocols where the broadcaster needs to …",2022
MAYANK VARIA,Formalizing Human Ingenuity: A Quantitative Framework for Copyright Law's Substantial Similarity,"A central notion in U.S. copyright law is judging the substantial similarity between an original and an (allegedly) derived work. Capturing this notion has proven elusive, and the many approaches offered by case law and legal scholarship are often ill-defined, contradictory, or internally-inconsistent. This work suggests that key parts of the substantial-similarity puzzle are amenable to modeling inspired by theoretical computer science. Our proposed framework quantitatively evaluates how much ''novelty'' is needed to produce the derived work with access to the original work, versus reproducing it without access to the copyrighted elements of the original work. ''Novelty'' is captured by a computational notion of description length, in the spirit of Kolmogorov-Levin complexity, which is robust to mechanical transformations and availability of contextual information. This results in an actionable framework that could be used …",2022

MAYANK VARIA,Brief announcement: Asynchronous verifiable information dispersal with near-optimal communication,"We present a near-optimal asynchronous verifiable information dispersal (AVID) protocol. The total dispersal cost of our AVID protocol is O(|M| + κ n^2), and the retrieval cost per client is O(|M| + κ n). Unlike prior works, our AVID protocol only assumes the existence of collision-resistant hash functions. Also, in our AVID protocol, the dispersing client incurs a communication cost of O(|M|+κ n) in comparison to O(|M|+κ n łog n) of prior best. Moreover, each node in our AVID protocol incurs a storage cost of O(|M|/n + κ) bits, in comparison to O(|M|/n + κ łog n) bits of prior best. Finally, we present lower bound results on communication cost and show that our AVID protocol has near-optimal communication costs -- only a factor of O(κ) gap from the lower bounds.",2022
MAYANK VARIA,Practical and improved byzantine reliable broadcast and asynchronous verifiable information dispersal from hash functions,"This paper improves upon two fundamental and closely related primitives in fault-tolerant distributed computing---Byzantine reliable broadcast (BRB) and asynchronous verifiable information dispersal (AVID). We make improvements asymptotically (for our AVID construction), concretely (much lower hidden constants), and practically (having 3 steps, using hash functions only, and avoiding using online error correction on the bulk data). The state of the art BRB protocol of Das, Xiang, and Ren (DXR BRB, CCS 2021) uses hash functions only and achieves a communication overhead of , where , , and  are the number of replicas, the message length, and the security parameter, respectively. More precisely, DXR BRB incurs a concrete communication of , with a large constant 7 for the bulk data term (ie, the  term). Das, Xiang, and Ren asked an open question if it is possible"" from a practical point of view to make the hidden constants small."" Two other limitations of DXR BRB that authors emphasized are that"" higher computation costs due to encoding and decoding of the message"" due to applying error correcting codes on bulk data and the fact that"" in the presence of malicious nodes, each honest node may have to try decoding  times"" due to the use of an online error correcting algorithm. Meanwhile, the state of the art AVID protocols achieve  communication assuming trusted setup. Apparently, there is a mismatch between BRB and AVID protocols: another natural open problem is whether it is possible to build a setup-free AVID protocol with  communication. In this work, we answer all these open questions in …",2022
MAYANK VARIA,TVA: A multi-party computation system for secure and expressive time series analytics,"We present TVA, a multi-party computation (MPC) system for secure analytics on secret-shared time series data. TVA achieves strong security guarantees in the semi-honest and malicious settings, and high expressivity by enabling complex analytics on inputs with unordered and irregular timestamps. TVA is the first system to support arbitrary composition of oblivious window operators, keyed aggregations, and multiple filter predicates, while keeping all data attributes private, including record timestamps and user-defined values in query predicates. At the core of the TVA system lie novel protocols for secure window assignment:(i) a tumbling window protocol that groups records into fixed-length time buckets and (ii) two session window protocols that identify periods of activity followed by periods of inactivity. We also contribute a new protocol for secure division with a public divisor, which may be of independent interest. We evaluate TVA on real LAN and WAN environments and show that it can efficiently compute complex window-based analytics on inputs of 2 22 records with modest use of resources. When compared to the state-of-the-art, TVA achieves up to 5.8× lower latency in queries with multiple filters and two orders of magnitude better performance in window aggregation.",2023

Until lately, however, the lack of a simple approach for customizing SmartNICs to application requirements has limited the potential benefits. Intel's Configurable Network Protocol Accelerator (COPA) provides a customizable FPGA framework that integrates both hardware and software development to improve computation and commu-nication performance. In this first case study, we demonstrate the capabilities of the COPA framework with an application from cryptography - secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) - that utilizes hardware accelerators connected directly to host memory and the COPA network.

MAYANK VARIA,Multi-regulation computing: Examining the legal and policy questions that arise from secure multiparty computation,"This work examines privacy laws and regulations that limit disclosure of personal data, and explores whether and how these restrictions apply when participants use cryptographically secure multi-party computation (MPC). By protecting data during use, MPC offers the promise of conducting data science in a way that (in some use cases) meets or even exceeds most people's conceptions of data privacy. With MPC, it is possible to correlate individual records across multiple datasets without revealing the underlying records, to conduct aggregate analysis across datasets which parties are otherwise unwilling to share for competitive reasons, and to analyze aggregate statistics across datasets which no individual party may lawfully hold. However, most adoptions of MPC to date involve data that is not subject to privacy protection under the law. We posit that a major impediment to the adoption of MPC - on the data that …",2022

MAYANK VARIA,Secure account recovery for a privacy-preserving web service,"If a web service is so secure that it does not even know—and does not want to know—the identity and contact info of its users, can it still offer account recovery if a user forgets their password? This paper is the culmination of the authors’ work to design a cryptographic protocol for account recovery for use by a prominent secure matching system: a web-based service that allows survivors of sexual misconduct to become aware of other survivors harmed by the same perpetrator. In such a system, the list of account-holders must be safeguarded, even against the service provider itself.In this work, we design an account recovery system that, on the surface, appears to follow the typical workflow: the user types in their email address, receives an email containing a one-time link, and answers some security questions. Behind the scenes, the defining feature of our recovery system is that the service provider can perform email-based account validation without knowing, or being able to learn, a list of users’ email addresses. Our construction uses standardized cryptography for most components, and it has been deployed in production at the secure matching system.",2024
MAYANK VARIA,Can the Government Compel Decryption?

In this work, we propose a new approach to the foregone conclusion doctrine from Fisher v. U.S. that governs the answer to this question. The Holy Grail of this line of work would be a framework for reasoning about whether the testimony implicit in any action is already known to the government. In this paper we attempt something narrower. We introduce a framework for specifying actions for which all implicit testimony is, constructively, a foregone conclusion. Our approach is centered around placing the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate that it is not ""rely[ing] on the truthtelling"" of the respondent. Building on original legal analysis and using precise computer science formalisms, we propose demonstrability as a new central concept for describing compelled …",2022
MAYANK VARIA,Committing AVID with Partial Retrieval and Optimal Storage,"Asynchronous Verifiable Information Dispersal (AVID) allows a dealer to disperse a message  across a collection of server replicas consistently and efficiently, such that any future client can reliably retrieve the message  if some servers fail. Since AVID was introduced by Cachin and Tessaro in 2005, several works improved the asymptotic communication complexity of AVID protocols. However, recent gains in communication complexity have come at the expense of sub-optimal storage, which is the dominant cost in long-term archiving. Moreover, recent works do not provide a mechanism to detect errors until the retrieval stage, which may result in completely wasted long-term storage if the dealer is malicious. In this work, we contribute a new AVID construction that achieves optimal storage and guaranteed output delivery, without sacrificing on communication complexity during dispersal or retrieval. First, we introduce a technique that bootstraps from dispersal of a message with sub-optimal storage to one with optimal storage. Second, we define and construct an AVID protocol that is robust, meaning that all server replicas are guaranteed at dispersal time that their fragments will contribute toward retrieval of a valid message. Third, we add the new possibility that some server replicas may lose their fragment in between dispersal and retrieval (as is likely in the long-term archiving scenario). This allows us to rely on fewer available replicas for retrieval than are required for dispersal.",2024
MAYANK VARIA,Haven++: Batched and Packed Dual-Threshold Asynchronous Complete Secret Sharing with Applications,"Asynchronous complete secret sharing (ACSS) is a foundational primitive in the design of distributed algorithms and cryptosystems that require secrecy. Dual-threshold ACSS permits a dealer to distribute a secret to a collection of  servers so that everyone holds shares of a polynomial containing the dealer's secret. This work contributes a new ACSS protocol, called Haven++, that uses packing and batching to make asymptotic and concrete advances in the design and application of ACSS for large secrets. Haven++ allows the dealer to pack multiple secrets in a single sharing phase, and to reconstruct either one or all of them later. For even larger secrets, we contribute a batching technique to amortize the cost of proof generation and verification across multiple invocations of our protocol. The result is an asymptotic improvement in amortized communication and computation complexity, both for ACSS itself and for its application to asynchronous distributed key generation. We implement Haven++ and find that it improves performance over the hbACSS protocol of Yurek et al. by a factor of 3-10 or more across a wide range of parameters for the number of parties and batch size.",2024
MAYANK VARIA,Automated Exposure Notification for COVID-19,"In the current COVID-19 pandemic, various Automated Exposure Notification (AEN) systems have been proposed to help quickly identify potential contacts of infected individuals. All these systems try to leverage the current understanding of the following factors: transmission risk, technology to address risk modeling, system policies and privacy considerations. While AEN holds promise for mitigating the spread of COVID-19, using short-range communication channels (Bluetooth) in smartphones to detect close individual contacts may be inaccurate for modeling and informing transmission risk. This work finds that the current close contact definitions may be inadequate to reduce viral spread using AEN technology. Consequently, relying on distance measurements from Bluetooth Low-Energy may not be optimal for determining risks of exposure and protecting privacy. This paper’s literature analysis suggests that AEN …",2022

MAYANK VARIA,Request for Information (RFI) on Advancing Privacy Enhancing Technologies,"PETs provide an extremely powerful and versatile toolbox for controlled processing of data, while keeping the data itself hidden. Consequently, PETs allow for a radical rethinking of the possible uses of data, proving fine-grained control over which functions of data are to be exposed (and to whom) and which are to be kept hidden. When properly and responsibly used, this power of PETs can greatly advance democracy for the benefit of all individuals and communities. However, when used carelessly and irresponsibly, PETs can also cause great harm. Therefore, the adoption and development pf PETs should be done in a careful and principled way, while making sure to adequately educate the relevant constituents in the power and dangers of using PETs, and while taking care to provide adequate checks and balances that are appropriate to each and every use case.More specifically, used properly, PETs can cut the Gordian knot that pits transparency and accountability against privacy and secrecy in a seeemingly inherent way: It provides ways to obtain information that is inherently derived from private data but is crucial for good governance, while keeping the data private and at the same time providing public assurance to the correctness and relevance of the obtained information. But when deployed improperly or recklessly, PETs risk exacerbating inequities, reducing privacy, diminishing transparency and accountability, and undermining public confidence in government agencies and their data products. Furthermore, the power of PETs inevitably leads to a series of policy questions about when and how PETs should be deployed.",2022

Based on the existing literature, the direct constructions of optimal ZCCSs are limited to their lengths. This letter proposes a direct construction of optimal ZCCSs for all possible even lengths using generalized Boolean functions.

This problem is especially pertinent in natural language generation which requires ever-improving suites of datasets, metrics, and human evaluation to make definitive claims. To make following best model evaluation practices easier, we introduce GEMv2. The new version of the Generation, Evaluation, and Metrics Benchmark introduces a modular infrastructure for dataset, model, and metric developers to benefit from each others work.

ASHISH UPADHYAY,"Effect of preterm birth on early neonatal, late neonatal, and postneonatal mortality in India","Despite India having a high burden of infant deaths and preterm birth, there is a clear lack of studies documenting association between preterm birth and infant mortality in India. Additionally, existing studies have failed to account for unobserved heterogeneity while linking preterm birth with infant mortality. Hence, the present study examines association of preterm birth with early neonatal death (ENND), late neonatal death (LNND), and postneonatal death (PNND) in India. We used the reproductive calendar canvassed in the cross-sectional National Family Health Survey 2015–16 (NFHS-4) to identify preterm births. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the associations for all births, most-, second most-, and third most- recent births occurred in five years preceding NFHS-4. We use mother fixed-effect logistic regression to confirm the associations among all recent births. Among all births, preterm births were 4.2, 3.8, and 1.7 times as likely as full-term births to die during early neonatal, late neonatal, and postneonatal periods respectively. Among most recent births, preterm births were 4.4, 4.0, and 2.0 times as likely as full-term births to die during early neonatal, late neonatal, and postneonatal periods respectively. Preterm births were also associated with risk of only ENND, LNND, and PNND among the second most recent births. Preterm births were associated with risk of only ENND and LNND among the third most recent births.

ASHISH UPADHYAY,Prevalence of pain and its treatment among older adults in India: a nationally representative population-based study,"There were no estimates of the prevalence of pain and its treatment in the older population of India obtained from face-to-face interviews with a nationally representative sample. We addressed this evidence gap by using data on 63,931 individuals aged 45 years and older from the 2017/2018 Longitudinal Ageing Study in India. We identified pain from an affirmative response to the question: Are you often troubled by pain? We also identified those who reported pain that limited usual activities and who received treatment for pain. We estimated age-and sex-adjusted prevalence of pain, pain limiting usual activity and treatment, and compared these estimates across states and sociodemographic groups.

A multivariable decomposition regression analysis was performed. Results showed that the prevalence of childhood stunting declined from 49.4% in 1998–99 to 34.9% in 2015–16. Over the same period, the prevalence of childhood underweight declined from 41.9% in 1998–99 to 33.1% in 2015–16. The reduction in the prevalence of stunting was found to be contributed largely by a reduction in the combined prevalence of stunting and underweight (60%), followed by stunted only (21%) and the combined prevalence of stunting, underweight and wasting (19%). Likewise, the reduction in the prevalence of underweight was contributed by a reduction …",2022

While SGLT2-inhibitors’ ability to activate tubulo-glomerular feedback and reduce hyperfiltration-mediated kidney injury is considered to be the central mechanism for kidney protection, recent data from experimental studies raises questions on the primacy of this mechanism. This review examines SGLT2-inhibitors’ role in tubulo-glomerular feedback and summarizes emerging evidence on following of SGLT2-inhibitors’ other putative mechanisms for kidney protection: optimization of kidney’s energy substrate utilization and delivery, regulation of autophagy and maintenance of cellular homeostasis, attenuation of sympathetic hyperactivity, and improvement in vascular health and microvascular function.

ASHISH UPADHYAY,Content type profiling of data-to-text generation datasets.,"Data-to-Text Generation (D2T) problems can be considered as a stream of time-stamped events with a text summary being produced for each. The problem becomes more challenging when event summaries contain complex insights derived from multiple records either within an event, or across several events from the event stream. It is important to understand the different types of content present in the summary to help us better define the system requirements so that we can build better systems. In this paper, we propose a novel typology of content types, that we use to classify the contents of event summaries. Using the typology, a profile of a dataset is generated as the distribution of the aggregated content types which captures the specific characteristics of the dataset and gives a measure of the complexity present in the problem.

ASHISH UPADHYAY,A case-based approach for content planning in data-to-text generation,"The problem of Data-to-Text Generation (D2T) is usually solved using a modular approach by breaking the generation process into some variant of planning and realisation phases. Traditional methods have been very good at producing high quality texts but are difficult to build for complex domains and also lack diversity. On the other hand, current neural systems offer scalability and diversity but at the expense of being inaccurate. Case-Based approaches try to mitigate the accuracy and diversity trade-off by providing better accuracy than neural systems and better diversity than traditional systems. However, they still fare poorly against neural systems when measured on the dimensions of content selection and diversity. In this work, a Case-Based approach for content-planning in D2T, called CBR-Plan, is proposed which selects and organises the key components required for producing a summary, based on …",2022

The synthesis of Ag-NPs was ascertained by UV-VIS spectrophotometry of the incubated suspension of yellowish-brown at 400-410 nm. The Ag-NPs were further characterized using a High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope, which confirmed that the Ag-NPs were primarily spherical and had a size range of 5–100 nm with a maximum frequency fall between 5-20 nm, 21-30 nm, 31-50 nm and a few falls within 51-100 nm. In addition, Ag-NPs synthesized using sheep and pig wastes are characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering, which confirmed the high stability of Ag-NPs with a zeta potential of-27 and-32 mV respectively. Biomolecules and biological extracts of sheep and swine waste act as biogenic reducing and capping agents. Based on the zone of inhibition achieved through the agar well diffusion method, Ag-NPs biosynthesized using sheep waste showed high bactericidal properties against Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, and Micrococcus luteus as compared to swine waste-derived AgNPs.

Here, we report a case of MTX-LPD in a 58-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who was on methotrexate for 10 years. She presented with complaint of cough for 1 month with no B symptoms. Chest and abdomen computed tomography showed hilar, mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy and immunohistochemistry confirmed involvement with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. She was advised to stop methotrexate which resulted in complete regression of her lesions on PET CT within 1 month. For patients who are taking MTX for a long time, MTX associated LPD should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with diffuse lymphadenopathy to avoid unnecessary treatment as many of these cases can be cured with discontinuation of methotrexate alone.",2023

Particle identification using electron recoils and nuclear recoils can be done by the simultaneous measurement of phonon and scintillation light produced in the detector. A 100 g Sapphire detector has been fabricated and tested at the Texas A&M University, USA for the detection of rare events [3]. The detector shows a baseline resolution of∼ 18 eV. Even considering a 5σ conservative value of this resolution (∼ 90 eV), the detector would be an excellent candidate for low mass dark matter and CEνNS searches. The Sapphire detector produces a small amount of light (only∼ 1% of the deposited energy)[4] whose detection is quite challenging. A phonon-mediated Si detector of 100 g is used to amplify the scintillation light from Sapphire. The Si detector can be operated at high voltage mode (HV) with bias voltage applied upto 240 V. The threshold of the Si detector can be improved exploiting the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke (NTL)[5, 6] gain by applying high voltage bias across the detector. In this work we show the results of the collected light from the Sapphire detector paired with the Si detector which is operated at three different voltages. An expected linearity of amplified",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Quantum many-body scars: A quasiparticle perspective,"Weakly interacting quasiparticles play a central role in the low-energy description of many phases of quantum matter. At higher energies, however, quasiparticles cease to be well defined in generic many-body systems owing to a proliferation of decay channels. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars, which can give rise to certain species of stable quasiparticles throughout the energy spectrum. This goes along with a set of unusual nonequilibrium phenomena including many-body revivals and nonthermal stationary states. We provide a pedagogical exposition of this physics via a simple yet comprehensive example, that of a spin-1 XY model. We place our discussion in the broader context of symmetry-based constructions of many-body scar states, projector embeddings, and Hilbert space fragmentation. We conclude with a summary of experimental progress and theoretical puzzles.",2023
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,A constructive theory of the numerically accessible many-body localized to thermal crossover,"The many-body localised (MBL) to thermal crossover observed in exact diagonalisation studies remains poorly understood as the accessible system sizes are too small to be in an asymptotic scaling regime. We develop a model of the crossover in short 1D chains in which the MBL phase is destabilised by the formation of many-body resonances. The model reproduces several properties of the numerically observed crossover, including an apparent correlation length exponent , exponential growth of the Thouless time with disorder strength, linear drift of the critical disorder strength with system size, scale-free resonances, apparent  dependence of disorder-averaged spectral functions, and sub-thermal entanglement entropy of small subsystems. In the crossover, resonances induced by a local perturbation are rare at numerically accessible system sizes  which are smaller than a\emph {resonance length} . For (in lattice units), resonances typically overlap, and this model does not describe the asymptotic transition. The model further reproduces controversial numerical observations which Refs.[Suntajs et al 2019, Sels & Polkovnikov 2020] claimed to be inconsistent with MBL. We thus argue that the numerics to date is consistent with a MBL phase in the thermodynamic limit.",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Phenomenology of the prethermal many-body localized regime,"The dynamical phase diagram of interacting disordered systems has seen substantial revision over the past few years. Theory must now account for a large prethermal many-body localized regime in which thermalization is extremely slow, but not completely arrested. We derive a quantitative description of these dynamics in short-ranged one-dimensional systems using a model of successive many-body resonances. The model explains the decay timescale of mean autocorrelators, the functional form of the decay—a stretched exponential—and relates the value of the stretch exponent to the broad distribution of resonance timescales. The Jacobi method of matrix diagonalization provides numerical access to this distribution, as well as a conceptual framework for our analysis. The resonance model correctly predicts the stretch exponents for several models in the literature. Successive resonances may also underlie …",2023
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Many-body localization with quasiperiodic driving,"Sufficient disorder is believed to localize static and periodically driven interacting chains. With quasiperiodic driving by  incommensurate tones, the fate of this many-body localization (MBL) is unknown. We argue that randomly disordered MBL exists for , but not for . Specifically, a putative two-tone driven MBL chain is neither destabilized by thermal avalanches seeded by rare thermal regions, nor by the proliferation of long-range many-body resonances. For , however, sufficiently large thermal regions have continuous local spectra and slowly thermalize the entire chain. En route, we generalize the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to the quasiperiodically driven setting, and we verify its predictions numerically. Two-tone driving enables new topological orders with edge signatures; our results suggest that localization protects these orders indefinitely.",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Mean-field theory of failed thermalizing avalanches,"We show that localization in quasiperiodically modulated, two-dimensional systems is stable to the presence of a finite density of ergodic grains. This contrasts with the case of randomly modulated systems, where such grains seed thermalizing avalanches. These results are obtained within a quantitatively accurate, self-consistent entanglement mean-field theory, which analytically describes two level systems connected to a central ergodic grain. The theory predicts the distribution of entanglement entropies of each two level system across eigenstates, and the late time values of dynamical observables. In addition to recovering the known phenomenology of avalanches, the theory reproduces exact diagonalization data, and predicts the spatial profile of the thermalized region when the avalanche fails.",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Multimagnon quantum many-body scars from tensor operators,"We construct a family of three-body spin- Hamiltonians with a superextensive set of infinitely long-lived multimagnon states. A magnon in each such state carries either quasimomentum zero or fixed , and energy . These multimagnon states provide an archetypal example of quantum many-body scars: they are eigenstates at finite-energy density that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and lead to persistent oscillations in local observables in certain quench experiments. On the technical side, we demonstrate the systematic derivation of scarred Hamiltonians that satisfy a restricted spectrum-generating algebra using an operator basis built out of irreducible tensor operators. This operator basis can be constructed for any spin, spatial dimension, or continuous non-Abelian symmetry that generates the scarred subspace.",2022

A recently discovered example is the quantized pumping of energy into a cavity by a strongly coupled, periodically driven spin. We uncover a remarkable feature of these energy pumps: they coherently translate, or boost, a quantum state of the cavity in the Fock basis. Current optical cavity and circuit QED experiments can realize the required Hamiltonian in a rotating frame. Boosting thus enables the preparation of highly excited nonclassical cavity states in near-term experiments.",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Critical behaviour of the quasi-periodic quantum Ising chain,"The interplay of correlated spatial modulation and symmetry breaking leads to quantum critical phenomena intermediate between those of the clean and randomly disordered cases. By performing a detailed analytic and numerical case study of the quasi-periodically (QP) modulated transverse field Ising chain, we provide evidence for the conjectures of reference (Crowley et al 2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 175702) regarding the QP-Ising universality class. In the generic case, we confirm that the logarithmic wandering coefficient w governs both the macroscopic critical exponents and the energy-dependent localisation length of the critical excitations. However, for special values of the phase difference Δ between the exchange and transverse field couplings, the QP-Ising transition has different properties. For Δ= 0, a generalised Aubry–André duality prevents the finite energy excitations from localising despite the …",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Partial thermalisation of a two-state system coupled to a finite quantum bath,"The eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH) is a statistical characterisation of eigen-energies, eigenstates and matrix elements of local operators in thermalising quantum systems. We develop an ETH-like ansatz of a partially thermalising system composed of a spin-1/2 coupled to a finite quantum bath. The spin-bath coupling is sufficiently weak that ETH does not apply, but sufficiently strong that perturbation theory fails. We calculate (i) the distribution of fidelity susceptibilities, which takes a broadly distributed form,(ii) the distribution of spin eigenstate entropies, which takes a bi-modal form,(iii) infinite time memory of spin observables,(iv) the distribution of matrix elements of local operators on the bath, which is non-Gaussian, and (v) the intermediate entropic enhancement of the bath, which interpolates smoothly between zero and the ETH value of log 2. The enhancement is a consequence of rare many-body resonances, and is asymptotically larger than the typical eigenstate entanglement entropy. We verify these results numerically and discuss their connections to the many-body localisation transition.",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Unitary k-designs from random number-conserving quantum circuits,"Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global  charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of -fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a -design with  for a system in  spatial dimensions with linear dimension . Second, for , the depth  to converge to a -design scales as . In contrast, without number conservation . The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks   symmetries. The associated Goldstone modes are gapless and lead to the predicted scaling of . Our variational bounds hold for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions; we conjecture they are tight.",2023
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Integrability and quench dynamics in the spin-1 central spin XX model,"Central spin models provide an idealized description of interactions between a central degree of freedom and a mesoscopic environment of surrounding spins. We show that the family of models with a spin-1 at the center and XX interactions of arbitrary strength with surrounding spins is integrable. Specifically, we derive an extensive set of conserved quantities and obtain the exact eigenstates using the Bethe ansatz. As in the homogenous limit, the states divide into two exponentially large classes: bright states, in which the spin-1 is entangled with its surroundings, and dark states, in which it is not. On resonance, the bright states further break up into two classes depending on their weight on states with central spin polarization zero. These classes are probed in quench dynamics wherein they prevent the central spin from reaching thermal equilibrium. In the single spin-flip sector we explicitly construct the bright states and show that the central spin exhibits oscillatory dynamics as a consequence of the semilocalization of these eigenstates. We relate the integrability to the closely related class of integrable Richardson-Gaudin models, and conjecture that the spin- central spin XX model is integrable for any .",2023
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Momentum space entanglement of interacting fermions,"Momentum space entanglement entropy probes quantum correlations in interacting fermionic phases. It is very sensitive to interactions, obeying volume-law scaling in general, while vanishing in the Fermi gas. We show that the Rényi entropy in momentum space has a systematic expansion in terms of the phase space volume of the partition, which holds at all orders in perturbation theory. This permits, for example, the controlled computation of the entropy of thin shells near the Fermi wave vector in isotropic Fermi liquids and BCS superconductors. In the Fermi liquid, the thin-shell entropy is a universal function of the quasiparticle residue. In the superconductor, it reflects the formation of Cooper pairs. Momentum space Rényi entropies are accessible in cold atomic and molecular gas experiments through a time-of-flight generalization of previously implemented measurement protocols.",2023
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Efficient local classical shadow tomography with number conservation,"Shadow tomography aims to build a classical description of a quantum state from a sequence of simple random measurements. Physical observables are then reconstructed from the resulting classical shadow. Shadow protocols which use single-body random measurements are simple to implement and capture few-body observables efficiently, but do not apply to systems with fundamental number conservation laws, such as ultracold atoms. We address this shortcoming by proposing and analyzing a new local shadow protocol adapted to such systems. The All-Pairs protocol requires one layer of two-body gates and only  samples to reconstruct arbitrary few body observables. Moreover, by exploiting the permutation symmetry of the protocol, we derive a linear time postprocessing algorithm which applies to both hardcore bosons and spinless fermions in any spatial dimension. We provide a proof-of-principle …",2024
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Prethermal stability of eigenstates under high frequency Floquet driving,"Systems subject to high-frequency driving exhibit Floquet prethermalization, that is, they heat exponentially slowly on a timescale that is large in the drive frequency, . Nonetheless, local observables can decay much faster via energy conserving processes, which are expected to cause a rapid decay in the fidelity of an initial state. Here we show instead that the fidelities of eigenstates of the time-averaged Hamiltonian, , display an exponentially long lifetime over a wide range of frequencies—even as generic initial states decay rapidly. When  has quantum scars, or highly excited eigenstates of low entanglement, this leads to long-lived nonthermal behavior of local observables in certain initial states. We present a two-channel theory describing the fidelity decay time : the interzone channel causes fidelity decay through energy absorption, i.e., coupling across Floquet zones, and ties  to the slow …",2024

We develop a coupled layer construction for tight-binding models of these phases in  spatial dimensions, with any number of incommensurate drive frequencies . The models exhibit quantized responses associated with synthetic two- and four-dimensional quantum Hall effects in the steady state. A numerical study of the phase diagram for  shows (i) robust topological and trivial phases separated by a sharp phase transition, (ii) charge diffusion and a half-integer energy current between the drives at the transition, and (iii) a long-lived topological energy current which remains present when weak …",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Beyond Fermi's golden rule with the statistical Jacobi approximation,"Many problems in quantum dynamics can be cast as the decay of a single quantum state into a continuum. The time-dependent overlap with the initial state, called the fidelity, characterizes this decay. We derive an analytic expression for the fidelity after a quench to an ergodic Hamiltonian. The expression is valid for both weak and strong quenches, and timescales before finiteness of the Hilbert space limits the fidelity. It reproduces initial quadratic decay and asymptotic exponential decay with a rate which, for strong quenches, differs from Fermi's golden rule. The analysis relies on the statistical Jacobi approximation (SJA), which was originally applied in nearly localized systems, and which we here adapt to well-thermalizing systems. Our results demonstrate that the SJA is predictive in disparate regimes of quantum dynamics.",2023
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Constraining Many-Body Localization,"Figure 1: A box contains two species of particles separated by a partition (top). In an ergodic system, when the partition is removed, the particles mix. In a system that experiences many-body localization, the particles do not mix and instead retain memory of their initial conditions forever.A foundational tenet of statistical physics is the ergodic hypothesis, which states that macroscopic systems eventually explore all allowed microscopic configurations. Its far-reaching consequences include the impossibility of perpetual motion and the arrow of time. However, not all physical systems are ergodic. Systems with microscopic inhomogeneity can get stuck in certain configurations with striking consequences for their macroscopic properties. In both classical and quantum systems, the theoretical description of these nonergodic systems is incomplete. Simple models exhibit intricate phases with varying degrees of nonergodicity, but it is unclear how much they teach us about real-world systems. Two years ago, Alan Morningstar, now at Global Quantitative Strategies in Chicago, and colleagues identified several important regimes in inhomogeneous quantum systems and reconciled tensions between theoretical predictions and numerical observations [1]. Their research has since stimulated probes of nonergodicity and revitalized attempts to connect quantum and classical glasses.",2024
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Giant energy oscillations mediated by a quasiperiodically driven qubit,"A qubit driven by two incommensurate frequencies can mediate a quantized average energy current in the adiabatic limit. We show that nonadiabatic processes result in reversals of the energy current and corresponding oscillations in the net energy transferred between the drives. The oscillations are bounded but giant—much larger than the qubit energy splitting. A Landau-Zener analysis predicts that the timescale of the oscillations is exponentially large in the period of the drives. However, numerical analysis reveals that this timescale is not a monotonic function of the period and has increasing substructure as the adiabatic limit is approached. We show that this nonmonotonicity arises from interference effects between subsequent Landau-Zener transitions. Giant energy oscillations should be observable in near-term experiments with nitrogen-vacancy centers.",2023

In our study, we are examining Lyapunov exponents and spectral functions to investigate integrability as well as integrability-breaking perturbations. The isotropic Heisenberg model (XXX) with random couplings is fully integrable in the classical and quantum mechanical limit. However, the situation becomes more intricate when considering the XX case. While the quantum mechanical limit (S= 1/2) is integrable, giving rise to so-called bright and dark states, the problem becomes more sophisticated when dealing with larger spin values, particularly in the classical limit. Here, we have identified a completely regular manifold located within the middle of the spectrum, characterized by a vanishing Lyapunov exponent, rendering parts of the phase space non-ergodic.

Previously, the topological regime of such models was thought to be experimentally inaccessible due to a need for ultrastrong coupling; however, recent results have shown that the desired Hamiltonian is achievable in a rotating frame and can give rise to"" boosting"" of non-classical states of light in a cavity [2]. We show that the rotating magnetic field required for boosting can be achieved by combining an oscillatory flux bias with an amplitude modulated microwave drive in quadrature.

ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Absence of disordered Thouless pumps at finite frequency,"A Thouless pump is a slowly driven one-dimensional band insulator which pumps charge at a quantised rate. Previous work showed that pumping persists in weakly disordered chains, and separately in clean chains at finite drive frequency. We study the interplay of disorder and finite frequency, and show that the pump rate always decays to zero due to non-adiabatic transitions between the instantaneous eigenstates. However, the decay is slow, occurring on a time-scale that is exponentially large in the period of the drive. In the adiabatic limit, the band gap in the instantaneous spectrum closes at a critical disorder strength above which pumping ceases. We predict the scaling of the pump rate around this transition from a model of scattering between rare states near the band edges. Our predictions can be experimentally tested in ultracold atomic and photonic platforms.",2024

ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Eigenstate prethermalization,"Experimental advances in periodic driving fields allow for the manipulation of quantum phases of matter and the design of Floquet-engineered effective Hamiltonians. The driving, which breaks time translation invariance, ultimately thermalizes the system to a featureless infinite temperature state. Nevertheless, there are rigorous exponential-in-frequency bounds on the heating rates, allowing for nontrivial dynamics for long periods of time. While these bounds apply for global quasi-conservation laws such as energy, we show that even individual many-body eigenstates of a leading order effective Hamiltonian, H 0, show long-lived fidelity under the time evolution generated by the full, driven Hamiltonian. Our results have promising implications for Floquet engineering, and are especially interesting when H 0 has outlier eigenstates, called scar states.",2022

Here we take on the problem of computing the entanglement properties of translation-invariant systems of fermions in momentum space. We present perturbative calculations for both Fermi liquids and mean-field s-wave superconductors which reveal universal aspects of their Renyi entropies. We will also discuss measurement protocols that should allow for the measurement of momentum-space entanglement, including the case in which global symmetries are present.",2022
ANUSHYA CHANDRAN,Exploring 2D synthetic quantum Hall physics with a quasi-periodically driven qubit,"Quasi-periodically driven quantum systems are predicted to exhibit quantized topological properties, in analogy with the quantized transport properties of topological insulators. We use a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond to experimentally study a synthetic quantum Hall effect with a two-tone drive. We measure the evolution of trajectories of two quantum states, initially prepared at nearby points in synthetic phase space. We detect the synthetic Hall effect through the predicted overlap oscillations at a quantized fundamental frequency proportional to the Chern number, which characterizes the topological phases of the system. We further observe half-quantization of the Chern number at the transition between the synthetic Hall regime and the trivial regime, and the associated concentration of local Berry curvature in synthetic phase space. Our work opens up the possibility of using driven qubits to design and …",2022
